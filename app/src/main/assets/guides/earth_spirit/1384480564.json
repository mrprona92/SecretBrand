				"blink":"If you can't get your push and pull correct.
Just pull blink pull, roll, magnetize. :3
Easy game easy life.",
				"stout_shield":"I usually grab this just because melee~
Not necessary though...",
				"ghost":"Avoid being the center of attention you cute little thing~

You don't want to be the single target after your flawless combos so pop this after your roll ins or other situations so you don't get killed.",
				"clarity":"Grab one if you expect to be pushing / pulling or rolling a lot in your lane early on.",
				"bottle":"MID LANE Earth Spirit",
				"phase_boots":"These can be good but why do you need these when you can roll baby!

These are good if you have a good support or regen in your lane. Otherwise go for arcanes.",
				"power_treads":"Get these instead of arcanes if you have a CM giving mana or maybe your lane partner has them already.",
				"mekansm":"MID LANE Earth Spirit

Good to keep you alive as ES is not that item dependent for anything but hp",
				"force_staff":"You know what this does.

Use Force staff to get yourself into a good position to initiate or escape.",
				"dagon":"Why not!?

Be a bad mammajamma. See if I care.",
				"heart":"MONEY MONEY MONEY",
				"black_king_bar":"Get if there is a magic heavy team.
Don't want to get zapped when you are rolling around.",
				"shivas_guard":"Good to slow when a team is stunned after you have combo'd the crap out of them.",
				"vanguard":"Good for early regen and block.
Will keep you from going down too early in the game!~",
				"blade_mail":"Good since you roll right up in the other team's grill.",
				"soul_ring":"Quick boost of mana if you need to grab a stone or something. ",
				"arcane_boots":"These are your best bet so you can have a a good mana supply for all of your rockin' and rollin'.",
				"rod_of_atos":"Good if you need major help surviving team fights or just fights in general.

Also very good to single out a hero."

				"earth_spirit_boulder_smash":"This is good for smashing enemy heroes into bad places for them.  This ability is very stronk and can be mostly used to hit your stones.",
				"earth_spirit_rolling_boulder":"This is for rolling in and slowing the enemy heroes.
REMEMBER this will be cancelled if you are stunned...

Also you can travel further if you roll over one of your stones.

For mid Earth Spirits this can help you escape dirty situations :3",
				"earth_spirit_geomagnetic_grip":"This is your bread and butter for stuns.
Stun ladies with your cool rock / hero / creep pulling skills.

This is also good for pulling allies away from a bad situation if you can.",
				"earth_spirit_stone_caller":"REMEMBER!
These do NOT provide sight when they are placed.

Make sure you are tossing these bad boys out whenever you are near enemy heroes just to be safe.

Push / pull these to initiate and to pursue and stun.",
				"earth_spirit_magnetize":"Short timing but very good.  Make sure you throw this out when you have some stones around you and the enemy."
