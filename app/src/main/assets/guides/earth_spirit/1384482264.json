				"clarity":"After playing some more I've found his mana scales well but early game you really need the extra mana.",
				"travel_boots":"Once you get around level 15+ you might want to think about changing out the boots. It's really going to depend on how much you're using your mana boots. I've found by that time I'm using more for the party and it's wasted on me.",
				"assault":"Pick this or the Eye, it's personal choice really...",
				"heart":"Goes great for all tanks.",
				"basher":"So they can't run from you all that well.",
				"skadi":"Pick this or Cuirass, this just keeps them from running but your Skull Basher should manage that just fine. I'd pick the Cuirass honestly.",
				"heavens_halberd":"That added Support for those pesky carries. Works great to use just after you roll into them."

				"earth_spirit_geomagnetic_grip":"First ability, use this after putting a stone just past the enemies. Excellent for early harrassment.",
