				"stout_shield":"You can buy this at side-shop if no one else buys wards/courier.",
				"branches":"I usually build into wand, but if you are laning against someone without spells I build directly into mekanism. (Thats why you grab 2 instead of 3.)",
				"boots":"Build into Mana Boots ASAP to help with ganks, if you aren't doing that well in lane buy clarity instead.",
				"magic_wand":"Gives cheap, much needed burst regen.",
				"clarity":"Buy if you feel you don't need either a tango or a salve.",
				"flask":"Again, decide if Tangos or Healing Salve are needed in lane.",
				"dust":"In case of enemy invis, you chase well and are thus a good dust carrier. ",
				"bottle":"On a ganking hero this is a must have. Keeps your mana and health up.",
				"tango":"Keeps you in lane until you finish bottle.",
				"tpscroll":"Always carry TP's, especially on a ganker.",
				"mekansm":"A standard support item that gives ES some armor also.",
				"pipe":"Great for bouldering in unharmed.",
				"urn_of_shadows":"If you feel you have the money, or if you skip wand.",
				"sheepstick":"If the team has that 1 carry that you just need to shut down.",
				"force_staff":"Extra mobility and positioning. ",
				"heart":"Get instead of vanguard for great regen and health, or with vanguard for some nice tankyness. ",
				"shivas_guard":"Useful if you have more mana problems or need some slow to keep them in the teamfight/magnetize radius.",
				"bloodstone":"If you have a lot of extra money, and Scythe of Vyse doesn't seem necessary then bloodstone is a great way to spam your spells.",
				"vanguard":"If you feel you are dying to fast.",
				"arcane_boots":"Must have on such a mana dependent hero.",
				"smoke_of_deceit":"Feeling pro?",
				"veil_of_discord":"If vanguard seems a bit to much tank, and if your team has a lot of magic damage this is the place to be."

				"earth_spirit_boulder_smash":"A great nuke that also helps you either position enemy heroes, or chain a silence during your ult. If you feel that the damage isn't needed in your team comp then feel free to max Magnetic Grip first.",
				"earth_spirit_rolling_boulder":"A decent slow that is more useful in chasing down enemies and lining up your Boulder Smash.
The easiest combo for this is stun, roll, then smash them into your team or under tower.",
				"earth_spirit_geomagnetic_grip":"A useful stun that should be maxed first if you don't need the burst damage in boulder smash.",
				"earth_spirit_stone_caller":"Don't just spam these. Use deliberately right before a spell to line it up, if you keep throwing them down the enemy can position around them.
Keep your stack as full as possible whenever you plan to ult for an easy re-magnetize.",
				"earth_spirit_magnetize":"Feel free to use this your ult for solo ganks(if needed), but where it really shines is a teamfight.
Your goal in every teamfight is to magnetize everyone. Then silence and stun.(The status effects from Boulder Smash and Rolling Boulder affect all magnetized units)",
				"attribute_bonus":"Built in GG branches.
