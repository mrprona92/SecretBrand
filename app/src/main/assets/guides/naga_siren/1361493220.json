		{
				"naga_siren_mirror_image":"Awesome spell, synergizes godly with Diffusal Blade, Radiance and Manta.

Also makes it very easy for you to farm, as you can farm in lane the same time you're farming the jungle with Illusion's. 

Also makes pushing very easy once you get Radiance.",
				"naga_siren_ensnare":"Such a good spell. Ensnare which goes through BKB, makes you very scary in lane if you have a good lane partner with a follow-up stun.",
				"naga_siren_rip_tide":"Also an awesome spell. Does lots of damage and reduces Armor, makes you and everyone around you hit the target like an absolute truck, also it's AoE and it works with your illusions, so farming jungle/lanes gets even easier.",
				"naga_siren_song_of_the_siren":"Song of the Siren is an absolutely amazing spell. Makes everyone caught in it go to sleep, which makes them invulnerable and cannot be attacked, you can set up huge combos starting with this spell.

Also it's very short cooldown and has a huge range so you can dodge ganks very easily."
