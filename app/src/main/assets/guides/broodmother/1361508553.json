				"broodmother_spawn_spiderlings":"Use Spawn Spiderlings to earn last hits and push the lanes. Be careful not to feed these spiderlings to your opponents otherwise they will earn a lot of experience and gold.

You can use spiderlings made in lane to farm local jungle camps.",
				"broodmother_spin_web":"Spin Web let's you traverse over cliffs, through trees and anywhere unobstructed. Use it as an escape or to scout out areas near the lane in case of ganks.

Be careful of Sentry Wards as they disable your free pathing/walk. This ability works well with Soul Ring and Spawn Spiderlings ability.",
				"broodmother_incapacitating_bite":"Couple the slow and miss chance with Broodmother's ultimate and you have a very strong late-game carry.",
				"broodmother_insatiable_hunger":"Use this ultimate to heal yourself given its low cooldown. It's also great to shift tides of battle in your favour so long as you have Black King Bar to keep you consistently attacking and regaining life."
