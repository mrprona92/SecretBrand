		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"ward_sentry":"Always be prepared in advance for the difficulties that you may encounter in you lane.",
				"vladmir":"Get this item by 10-12 minute mark, it is very powerful early game for pushing and surviving, bonus armor to your broodlings as well as aura of lifesteal will be essential in pushing the lane.",
				"sheepstick":"Sheep stick is a great item, it provides one of best disable in the game and provides Broodmother with much needed mana regen, there are some situations in which getting this item instead of orchid will provide more for you and the team. And if you are having a great start my suggestion is get Hex.",
				"orchid":"Why buy Orchid? This item provides solid DPS in terms of damage and attack speed combined, as well as much needed mana regeneration and will be very usefull in team fights. But most importantly it allows you to get kill on those careless solo targets that decide to push out lane.",
				"assault":"Armor for broodlings and yourself as well as aura of attack speed and armor reduction on towers makes this item irreplaceable for pushing however it is still somewhat situation based depending on your team's item choices and enemy's pressure on you.",
				"black_king_bar":"This item will provide you durability in team fights, and escape mechanism since it will be much harder to lock you down, and prevent enemies from kiting you if you decide to engage them.",
				"shivas_guard":"Shiva's guard has two main purposes, provide AoE slow and damage in team fights and push creepwaves faster, this item is highly situational so you will have to coordinate with your team before going for this item.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"Great stable DPS item, is very useful if enemy team has evasion on them or you may simply interrupt teleports, some casting  skills and provides you with damage for pushing.",
				"radiance":"If you are able to get this item by 20-23 minute mark, then do not hesitate and do it, it will help you push a lane much faster and with the increase in range you are able to sit in trees and burn enemy creeps.",
				"butterfly":"Attack speed, damage, evasion and more armor from agility gain, great item on broodmother for offensive as well as defensive purposes.",
				"greater_crit":"If you are far ahead and dominating the game, this item will help you dominate it even more by providing DPS boost and giving you ability to get rid of squishy targets and towers faster, however it is highly situational and in my opinion it is better to go for stable damage.",
				"manta":"Manta style is great pushing item with many uses and if enemy team has Bounty Hunter or Slardar this item is essential to you to get rid of track or amplify damage .",
				"mjollnir":"Broodmother is all about pushing applying pressure to lane and destroying towers along with creep waves and what better item to do so than mjollnir, with recent range buff and shield buff this item became viable in teamfights as well as in pushing. However my personal preference is radiance.",
				"yasha":"Later to be assembled into manta style.",
				"abyssal_blade":"Solid Lockdown for a target, solid DPS for getting rid of squishy and semi-squishy targets fast, as well as DPS for pushing, great item on almost any melee hero and brood is no exception.",
				"heavens_halberd":"This item is highly situational but highly useful, it provides necessary disable for those hard hitting carries as well as decent slow and generally makes broodmother more tanky with evasion and strength gain. "

		{
				"broodmother_spawn_spiderlings":"Use your spiders to farm enemy jungle while you are in lane in the early portion of the game, prevent enemy from pulling by blocking camps or farming them yourself, in mid to late game use spiders to push lanes   while you yourself stay in the trees or enemy jungle.",
				"broodmother_spin_web":"Place your webs so that they do not overlap in the middle rather just the edges to maximize the area of coverage, always keep and escape path, it might be placing web on cliff or impassible terrain so enemy cant reach you, generally try to cover important neutral camps and lane.",
				"broodmother_incapacitating_bite":"This skill will provide you great solo kill potential on supports and squishy heroes in general but do not forget that you are a pusher and primarily should focus on that rather than going for kills.",
				"broodmother_insatiable_hunger":"I suggest getting this skill at level 6 because it might end up saving your life or help you push faster since it gives you 60+ damage for 14 seconds at level 6!"
