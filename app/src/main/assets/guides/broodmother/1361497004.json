		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"ring_of_protection":"You'll be building this into Basilius.",
				"branches":"You're only really getting these for the early stats. Feel free to sell them once you're on your feet.",
				"boots":"Don't get these until you have your Soul Ring. Your webs already give you great mobility.",
				"gem":"Brood's tankiness, survivability, and need to take out sentries all make her a fairly good gem carrier. However, only get it after you're tanky and if you're doing well in terms of deaths. Losing it to the enemy could be a disaster for you.",
				"talisman_of_evasion":"The evasion will stack with you passive, only giving the enemy a 33% chance of even hitting you. Makes you terrifying in 1 vs 1. Get this if your farming well, since it builds into the quite costly butterfly, or trade your extensions altogether for a more balanced build.",
				"ward_sentry":"Sentry wards are Broodmother's mortal weakness. Unless you have a reliable support, or you're lucky and end up laning against opponents too stupid to buy sentries, pick up a set of sentry wards and counter ward as needed. I like to pick up a set with my starting items, just in case.",
				"tango":"Once you get a few levels in your webs, you'll basically have infinite tangos.",
				"tpscroll":"Always carry a few of these on you. You're not the most mobile hero, so you'll need TPs to make it to teamfights or to return to your lane quickly.",
				"power_treads":"It's best to keep them set to int before you get your orchid to help with mana regen, but feel free to toggle them as needed.",
				"poor_mans_shield":"Pick one up if you need a little extra durability in lane, it's something I see in a lot of pro games. I prefer to save the gold for core items, though.",
				"vladmir":"As mentioned before, I don't particularly like using Vlad's on Brood, but it's not necessairly because Vlad's itself is bad. Only use it when you really need the bonuses, nobody else has one, and your core is finished.",
				"ring_of_basilius":"The mana regen is very helpful, and the armor for you spiderlings isn't too bad either. However, contrary to most people, I don't actually recommend building it into a Vlad's. You don't really need lifesteal, the extra armor isn't all that beneficial, and it delays other core items.",
				"orchid":"The silence makes Brood terrifying in 1v1 combat, and can be used to silence key players in teamfights. Also gives Brood all the mana she'll ever need.",
				"assault":"If nobody else on your team has Assault Cuirass and you have gold to spare, consider picking one up. Great for giving your team that last push at the end.",
				"black_king_bar":"This gives Brood quite a bit of tankiness, and the magic immunity is very helpful in both 1v1 fights and teamfights. Pop it and your ult, and you're very hard to kill for about 5 seconds.",
				"butterfly":"Geared more towards fighting than pushing. Very expensive, but it turns you into an absolute monster. If you don't have the farm for one, go for a Manta Style.",
				"manta":"If you got Yasha, this will be your core extension. The illisons give you excellet pushing power. Gather a small army of spiderlings, use your ult and Manta, and the towers will melt.",
				"yasha":"Attack speed, damage, and extra movement speed, all for a relatively cheap price. You should probably go this route if you farm isn't quite as good. It'll build into Manta, which is the cheaper of the two. You could also sacrifice your extensions altogether for a more balanced build.",
				"soul_ring":"This is going to be your answer to all of your mana problems. Soul Ring is absolutely core on Broodmother. Buy the recipe with your starting items, and rush the rest before anything else. Your webs will allow you to laugh off the health cost.",
				"ring_of_aquila":"Not particularly a top priority, but the extra stats aren't bad for the gold."

		{
				"broodmother_spawn_spiderlings":"Your spiderlings have two functions: pushing lanes and harassing enemy heroes. Bind select all other units to an easily accessable key. When not pushing, harass squishy heroes with the spiders. The nuke itself is a great finishing blow in a fight. Be careful not to feed the spiderlings.",
				"broodmother_spin_web":"Your webs make you incredibly hard to kill with invisibility and what amounts to an infinite tango. Place them all over your lane. Constantly pop out of your web, attack an enemy hero once or twice, then fall back.",
				"broodmother_incapacitating_bite":"You might want to consider getting this over an earlier level of your webs (not level 1 webs!) to harass carries trying to farm. It depends on your laning situation. This skill makes Brood terrifying in 1v1 combat.",
				"broodmother_insatiable_hunger":"Unless you really need lifesteal, don't get this until level 9. Your webs and spiderlings are more important. Don't activate it until after you hit someone with your passive to get the most out of it. Also great for taking down towers."
