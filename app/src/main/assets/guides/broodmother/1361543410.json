		{
				"stout_shield":"Use spiders to Scout out Enemies mid game, place one in most entraces to their jungle, they last for quite a while and give good vision. Unless they smoke gank you or have Invisibility , they should NOT be able to sneak up onto you with a gem.
Also, Ward/Gem/Dust check everytime they come out of fog",
				"branches":"Your Initial job is to be a massive bitch down their easy lane (She does it rather well)
You are doing your job right if 
+ Their carry has no farm
+They constantly have two to three heroes in your lane
+Lots of Sentries/Gem runs at you",
				"clarity":"Get your Soul ring up ASAP.
Spam it on every cool down to build more spiders or even to just nuke their carry/support.

Select 5 to 8 spiders and right click supports, build a web over their tower to prevent juking, if the carry is alone, RAPE HIM with spiders.",
				"flask":"General hero instuctions:

You are going against the tri-lane, Your first two webs matter a LOT when they sentry up, Place and replace them wisely. Your initial goal to is reach level 3 ASAP, and get your soul ring up",
				"tango":"Spam Spiders to throw their underleveled supports out of lane. Its a very powerful skill and the spiders are very powerful early game.
450 hp against supports with Aoe nukes of 100 to 200 damage and enough mana only to spam it once or twice.
You have soul ring and unlimited spiders.",
				"tpscroll":"You should be Split Pushing and putting massive pressure on their easy lane but, always keep a goddam TP scroll, there might be opportunities where you can teamwipe instead of just pushing a tower down, Kill them and then push a tower down.",
				"power_treads":"Standard, Treads are the best besides travels, Brood really needs some attack Speed. Phase isn't required because you are pretty fast and you should be microing spiders to block if you're chasing with the main hero.",
				"hand_of_midas":"Very Situational, If you're dominating the tri-lane, brood mother is a very powerful midas user, helps to power jungle with spiders while keeping the lane pushed.",
				"sheepstick":"Really Late game, You can sell orchid for Hex, or you could just buy a straight hex instead of orchid.
It offers a better disable, more mana than you will ever need and a bit of health.",
				"orchid":"Its more or less situational, but i think its very powerful in most games, Lets you dominate the midgame, and force more than one support onto their easy lane to babysit their carry mid game(which allows your teammates to split push or ease the pressure)

Also Silence.",
				"assault":"Massive Attackspeed + A little attackspeed for spiders ( though by the time you get it, you should mostly be using spiders to jungle)",
				"black_king_bar":"Needed in most games as brood has two major issues, She is kited rather easy in teamfights and gets disabled easy.
Also allows to pick off in 2v1's or 3v1's and it dispels dust/track and allows bkb tp's when they 5 man gank you with a gem(Yes they will if you're playing right.)",
				"monkey_king_bar":"+Good Damage
+Ministun
+Truestrike ( You cannot miss, except for backtrack)

You should be focusing their supports down pretty fast with your ultimate. (Before Abbysal)",
				"butterfly":"+Evasion (Dont make if opponents are making mkb, you can get the same attackspeed from Mjolnir/Assault)
",
				"greater_crit":"Crits are good Very late game, but i'm generally against it, as you get more stable dps from MKB upto a certain point( Where most games should end on a good broodmother note.)",
				"manta":"Very useful when you pick up an early Yasha' as it gives you good attackspeed and pretty much caps your movement speed in webs

+ Dispels Dust/Track
+Illusions get the slow/miss orb
-Your ulti is a giveaway (Situationally)
",
				"mjollnir":"Gives broodmother massive attackspeed and another pushing tool.
It stacks with Bite in the sense, whenever Mjolnir Procs  you chainlightning, otherwise you use your Bite orb.",
				"soul_ring":"A Must have Item on all broodmothers. Spamming Spiders early game is what destroys a lot of tri-lanes. Heroes like Crystal Maiden,Jakiro etc cannot keep spamming their nukes to clear the 450 HP spiders (and don't forget they will be underleveled, so the nukes dont destroy spiders)
-Sell on Orchid",
				"abyssal_blade":"+Bash
+Lockdown that goes through bkb
+Makes you a powerful AntiCarry as you can ulti bkb and rightclick their carry into a stalemate (Brood isn't a powerful carry but between Bite ,Abbysal  and Ulti you can buy enough time for your carry to beat up their supports.",
				"heavens_halberd":"Poor mans Evasion + Disable.. Useful in games where you're doing absolutely badly and need to shut their dps carry down.

				"broodmother_spawn_spiderlings":"Spam Spiders once you reach level 3.
Use spiders to Harass their supports out of  the tri-lane. ( Remember they will be underleveled and cannot stand up to much spider harass nor can they clear them  outfast enough ) 
Deny creeps, Last hit creeps with spiders to make more.
Jungle farm with them.",
				"broodmother_spin_web":"Place your webs smartly, cover maximum ground, destroy trees and remember, if they  sentry ward early game, change your web spot as the wards have limited vision and you can destroy trees with wards, you just need to leach exp till 3 (use dota_range_display 1200  to know your exp range)'",
				"broodmother_incapacitating_bite":"Your Mid game Anti-carry and chase tool.
Do not underestimate the slow nor the miss chance it causes,",
				"broodmother_insatiable_hunger":"Use it liberaly. I would suggest against taking at 6 when facing a tri-lane as you need the web regen and ground covered a lot more than your ulti.

But use ulti to throw heros off lane, heal up in the jungle and to pop towers."
