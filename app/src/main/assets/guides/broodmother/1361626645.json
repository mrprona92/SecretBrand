				"power_treads":"Use them in a smart way. Switch stats if you will need to revorer HPMP or if you need to do more damage with right clicks. It will be usefull too, if you'll switch them before using skills (in earlymid game).",
				"ring_of_basilius":"This item it's not necessary, but I suggest it to you if you want to push as hell. It will also help you with your mana problems if you want to spam Spawn Spiderlings  without waiting Soul Ring's cooldown time.",
				"orchid":"This item will solve your mana problems at all, and will help you to carry out your game (and be more usefull in teamfights). Remember that you can use it to silence one of your enemies (maybe a disabler) and then attacking the other one.",
				"butterfly":"Buy this if you want to carry more.",
				"manta":"Buy this if you want to push even more.",
				"soul_ring":"Pick the recipe when you start, so you won't need courier at all, unless you will have to buy Orchid. (or if you want to go also into Basilius)",
				"ring_of_aquila":"Buy this only if you have extra money."
