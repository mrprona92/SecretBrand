		{
				"gloves":"To be built into a Hand of Midas",
				"boots":"Boots of Speed. Everyone needs them.",
				"flask":"Good for healing after you devour the big creep camp at level 1.",
				"phase_boots":"As you don't have a reliable stun or slow, this is great for escaping if you are being hunted, and good for catching up to fleeing heroes.",
				"hand_of_midas":"This item enhances your attack speed, and makes your GPM go out of control. Use whenever off cooldown.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Makes your DOOM extremely potent.",
				"refresher":"DOOM two heroes at once!",
				"assault":"Attack Speed and Armour. An all-round useful item , seeing that doom has little to no armour.",
				"heart":"Gives you a great amount of strength, which is your primary stat, and the health and regeneration greatly increases your survivability.",
				"rapier":"If you are doing a GODLIKE... and you can survive.",
				"radiance":"The Core item for Doom-Bringer. Yes, it helps your farm, but the damage addition and the burn damage allows you to start really participating in fights.",
				"basher":"Allows your attacks to have a chance to stun, which is great, and can be built into a Abyssal Blade.",
				"sange_and_yasha":"Good for stats and movement speed. The Slow proc is helpful for getting those pickoff kills.",
				"satanic":"Lifesteal galore! Great for turning around fights when you activate it.",
				"mjollnir":"More Attack Speed, and the Chain Lightning and Shield increases your teamfight.",
				"abyssal_blade":"Build from your skull basher. Gives you a target-able stun, and insane amounts of damage, and a good amount of Strength",
				"ring_of_aquila":"Not really required , but great to get some mana regeneration and armour."

				"doom_bringer_lvl_death":"Good for timing ganks, but make sure they meet the level criteria before moving in, and get your team in the lane to help.",
				"doom_bringer_doom":"A counter to all heroes, I recommend using to disable heroes that have invisibility, or team-fight heroes so they cannot cast those troublesome spells.",
