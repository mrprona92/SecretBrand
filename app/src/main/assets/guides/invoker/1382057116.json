- Damage disable no longer ignores self damage",
				"ghost":"Good stats gain and survivability against Ursa, SA, Huskar, etc.",
				"travel_boots":"v6.79 Changes

- Now prioritizes nearby structures first within 325 AoE from targeting position (when ground targeted)

Best boots for Invoker now",
				"phase_boots":"16% MS boost is synergizes well with Wex",
				"hand_of_midas":"Get this item if you can do so around the 6th minute. Otherwise, forget it. Invoker is more concerned about levels than gold, so transmute level six creeps for 2.5x the experience! Note: an entire set of beginning creep wave gives 227 XP. Transmuting with Midas on a level 6 creep gives 297 XP!",
				"sheepstick":"Hex, refresh, Hex again!
Best item for ganking. Very costly, but it is worth the price. Get this item before Aghanim Scepter if you are desperate to end the game.",
				"cyclone":"v6.79 Changes

- Cyclone cooldown reduced from 30 to 25
- Movement speed bonus inGreat item for any invoker build. However, it does not solve the low damage output of wex invoker. The 2.5 second lift duration is a perfect setup for sunstrike, meteor, and blast combo (Around 1100 damage after reducti",
				"force_staff":"Great item for the team! This item has the most flexibility. Highly recommended against Stealth Assassin, nature's prophet, and clock. In addition, you can push enemies out of position, save your team, force enemy onto impassable terrain, etc. If you have fast reflexes, Force Staff yourself to dodge",
				"dagon":"Dagon, Refresh, Dagon again!",
				"necronomicon":"Amazing synergy with spirits/snap combo. True sight makes this item very useful against TA/BH etc. Great defense against Pudge's hooks. 4 summons and Cold Snap will likely kill your target. 4 summons plus alacrity can hurt towers real good.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"This is my favorite item. However, Doom, Silencer, Nyx, OD, and NS counters this item. I like to get this item after one of the following: Force Staff, Drums of Endurance, Euls Scepter, Rod of Atos, or Orchid Malevolence.",
				"black_king_bar":"Great item for the Hybrid invoker. Activate this item after Silencer uses his ultimate. Enemies will charge in thinking they have impunity. Now is your best chance to Tornado, Meteor, Blast, and Ice Wall. On the other hand, if you activate BK",
				"sphere":"Great item against Doom, Nyx, and sudden Hex/Orchid. However, this item is very costly."

If Quas is low level, cast Cold Snap with a distance around 300 or your next attack will not trigger Cold Snap because it will be on cooldown. Most of the time, it is a good idea to use animation canceling during Cold Snap's duration. ",
				"invoker_ghost_walk":"     Ghost walk can dodge certain projectiles. Invoke interrupts TP scroll, but Ghost Walk does not. Ghost Walk's slow aura is not blocked by magic immunity! In the lane phase, if you have QQQ orbs active, you could quickly hit WRV to Ghost Walk. Eul self, then shift QQWR works in Dota 1, but not in",
				"invoker_tornado":"     Tornado can be used to stack creep camps by lifting them in at the spawn time. Tornado is a good spell to have ready against Pudge. If hooked, Tornado nearby anywhere asap and you can prevent Dismember. Tornado also gives a great area of vision! You can use it for Sun Strikes or hunt heroes",
				"invoker_alacrity":"     Besides your team carry, Alacrity on Forge Spirits or siege creep is a great way to push towers from a distance.  Make sure to put Alacrity on Void.",
				"invoker_chaos_meteor":"     Meteor provides a small vision; Cold Snap quickly! Double Meteor does not stack anymore; however, if you keep the distance between two Meteors more than 300, Meteor will deal 90% or more of it's damage. Meteor with one level of Exort can be used as a scare tactic (Do not consider this without A",
				"invoker_forge_spirit":"You can also block hooks/arrow by summoning spirit!  Use smoke on Forge Spirits and have entire team backdoor by teleporting on Forge Spirits (Beware backdoor protection)!  Use spirits to help you controle runes.",
				"invoker_ice_wall":"     If Ice Wall deals 10 or more damage after reduction, it will trigger Cold Snap. Ice wall with two or more Exort will remove Templar Assassins refraction every second. Casting ice Wall in front of your tower can provide a great defense. Although opposing heroes are unlikely to be caught, you can",
				"invoker_deafening_blast":"This spell can push opponents on/off cliffs.
Deaf Blast can counter BKB.  Disarm is not removed after BKB activation.  Blast is a great spell to combo with Sun Strike. Blast can also be used to \"PULL\" targets! Use Tornado or Eul first, then time blast so that target gets hit by back end of blast."
