A great nuke that can be used in team fights and farming later in the game. 
Most of the times in team fights, you'll want to try to get within melee range (if your brave enough) of your target so that your Starfall has another chance to strike them for half damage. So glorious. ",

Mirana's glorious signature skill, Sacred Arrow has the potential to be the longest single-target stun in the game. With a bit of &quot;practice&quot;, it can be one of the greatest ganking skills.
Such a Yenius Skill. 

&quot;Sacred Arrow should not always be used as an initiation tool.&quot; ",

The leap of faith, nothing much to say about this skill, but most of the time leap is better left as an escape and chasing mechanism -- rarely one for initiation.

2. Sniper's Ultimate 
And more! ",
