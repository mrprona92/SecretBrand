				"dust":"Uses: DO NOT LET Riki, BH, Brood, SNOWBALL!!",
				"courier":"Hard Supports buy courier or go home!!",
				"power_treads":"My boots of choice for AA, unlike other supports this hero benefits quite a bit from auto attacks when using chilling touch properly. The attack speed/suriviability these provide work wonders on AA. NOTE: Tread swtiching can save your life or help take another -_0		",
				"mekansm":"the Bread and Butter Hard Support Item get ASAP",
				"flying_courier":"1st item Pick-up",
				"urn_of_shadows":"Great early game pick up. Gives much needed Mana regen when you dont buy Arcane boots. This item can mean the difference between your life or death, also can give your ice blast just that little push it needs to make your enemies SHATTER!!",
				"sheepstick":"Only when you have a HUGE amount of extra Gold",
				"cyclone":"All around good utility Item that Gives Cold Feet 100%succes rate. Rotation: Cold Feet-scepter",
				"force_staff":"Definite Pick up should you have extra Gold.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"I very nice pick-up should you have extra gold after ward/smoke upkeep. Makes your Ice-Blast a force to be noted 17 seconds without health regen is no joke!",
				"arcane_boots":"Great support item Prefered when your team is in need of mana regen.
Ex: no other arcane boots, or mana regen passive",
				"tranquil_boots":"All Boots are viable on AA. Though i wouldnt reccomend Tranquils with my guide since I advise heavy use of your ability chilling touch. Tranquils do however come into play if your team comp doesnt benefit too much from early levels of Chilling touch, which is almost never the case."

It can also be used to give slight vision on the field and Mini-map.Use after Ice Vortex to increase Cold Feet success chance. Also use during a chase or get away as it slows hero movement Significantly. Keep this up during any team fight",
