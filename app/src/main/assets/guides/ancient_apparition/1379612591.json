				"rod_of_atos":"You want to pick up Atos when you feel enemies are getting away and/or avoiding your Cold Feet. The extra life and intelligence is very welcomed on AA."

				"ancient_apparition_ice_vortex":"Make sure when casting Cold Feet to cast Ice Vortex as well, the extra damage and slow could net you that stun that you need. Ice Vortex is also a great way to see up cliffs and fogged areas.

Vortex is not efficient in the middle lane, so getting it so early isn't practical.",
				"ancient_apparition_chilling_touch":"It's debatable whether you want to get Chilling Touch or not. The extra damage is magical and would only help a selective amount of carries. ",

				"attribute_bonus":"These stats are to help with your early-game survivability and to help you last hit."
