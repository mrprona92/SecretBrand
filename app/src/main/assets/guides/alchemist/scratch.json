				"quelling_blade":"WHY DOES THIS AXE ONLY DO MORE DAMAGE TO CREEPS? WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU'RE JUST STORING IT IN YOUR BACKPACK. FORTUNATELY FOR YOU, THE CREEPS ARE FAR TOO DUMB TO NOTICE THAT YOUR BARE FISTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY BLADED AXES.",
				"stout_shield":"ANOTHER EXCELLENT TOOL IN THE WAR AGAINST HARASS. JUST ONE SERVING OF STOUT SHIELD A DAY COULD PROTECT YOU FROM THE DANGERS OF CREEP AGGRO AND ENEMY ATTACKS! WHO KNEW?",
				"branches":"GG STICKS ENSURE A GOOD GAME (FOR YOU) AND ARE THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE STATS ON THE MARKET.",
				"boots":"GOTTA GO FAST.",
				"flask":"ALWAYS BRING A SALVE TO LANE. BUT ONLY ONE! WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS, DIABLO OR SOMETHING? HAHAHA.",
				"ward_observer":"IF THESE AREN'T ON COOLDOWN RIGHT NOW, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BE YELLING AT YOUR SUPPORTS TO BUY (AND PLACE) MORE OF THEM!",
				"tango":"EAT A TREE TO REGAIN POWER!",
				"courier":"THE FACT THAT YOU EVEN CONSIDERED BUYING DONKEY RIGHT NOW MAKES ME QUESTION YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GUIDE...",

				"travel_boots":"FOR THE MAN WHO HAS TRULY FINISHED FARMING, THESE STYLISH BOOTS WILL LET YOU BACKDOOR WITH IMPUNITY.",
				"power_treads":"THESE TREADS HAVE 'POWER' RIGHT IN THE GODDAMN NAME. THAT ALONE SHOULD TELL YOU WHY THESE ARE A CORNERSTONE IN ALL GOOD ALCHEMIST BUILDS.",
				"hand_of_midas":"EVIDENTLY, THIS WAS THE SECRET ALL ALONG.

BUY THIS CREEPY MUMMIFIED HAND IF YOU FEEL SAFE GOING LATE, BUT REMEMBER THAT YOUR GREATEST POWER IS THE ABILITY TO DESTROY THE MIDGAME!",
				"vladmir":"VLAD JUST MADE YOU AN OFFER THAT YOU CANNOT REFUSE. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE SIX-SLOTTING LIKE A CHAMP, SO MAKE ONE OF YOUR ALLIES BUY THIS ITEM INSTEAD.",
				"assault":"FUN FACT: CUIRASS IS ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED 'QUEER-ASS'.

SO THERE'S THAT.",
				"black_king_bar":"THE FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY BAR WILL PREVENT HATERS FROM INTERRUPTING YOUR PERMABASH SESSION WITH A PESKY STUN OF THEIR OWN.",
				"radiance":"AT SEVENTEEN MINUTES, ALCHEMIST WALKED IN TO THE JUNGLE. AND BY TWENTY-ONE, HE WALKED OUT. AND BY GOD, HE WAS RICH.

AUTHOR'S NOTE: THIS ITEM PRESENTS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MIDAS, AS RADIANCE AND ACID SPRAY LET YOU JUNGLE IN A HURRY.",
				"basher":"WHEN YOUR TWO MOST RECENT PURCHASES ARE HAMMERS, EVERYONE STARTS TO LOOK LIKE A GODDAMN MONEY PINIATA. AT LEAST, I THINK THAT'S THE SAYING.",
				"invis_sword":"ALSO KNOWN AS THE INVINCIBILITY BLADE IN PUBS, THIS ITEM GRANTS YOU A MYRIAD OF WONDERFUL BONUSES, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT LETS YOU HIDE A FULLY CHARGED STUN AND SMASH IT OVER SOME POOR BASTARD'S SKULL.",
				"mjollnir":"CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE SURVIVED INTO THE MID-LATEGAME. YOU NOW HAVE TWO FINE HAMMERS (AMONG OTHER THINGS) AND DECIDING WHICH TO UPGRADE FIRST IS UP TO YOU. BUT JUST REMEMBER, IF YOU'RE NOT ATTACKING FIVE TIMES PER SECOND, WHY EVEN BOTHER PLAYING AT ALL?",
				"maelstrom":"EVER WISH YOU COULD PUNCH SO HARD THAT YOU BLASTED LIGHTNING OUT OF YOUR BARE GODDAMN HANDS? SO DID ALCHEMIST, WHICH IS WHY HE BUILDS MAELSTROM EVERY GAME.",
				"mask_of_madness":"GREET THE DAY BY PUNCHING THE SUN!

AUTHOR'S NOTE: THIS ITEM PRESENTS AN ALTERNATIVE PLAYSTYLE NOT OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED BY THIS GUIDE!
BUYERS BEWARE!",
				"abyssal_blade":"THE BRUSHED METAL FINISH AND INLAID GEMSTONE ON THE HILT MAKE THIS WEAPON THE PERFECT ACCESSORY FOR THE MURDER TRAIN OF DISCRIMINATING TASTE."
