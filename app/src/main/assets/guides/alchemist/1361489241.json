This item will be built into Mask of Madness.",

",
				"assault":"Pushing late game and the stacking with your Acid Spray does very well.",

				"alchemist_unstable_concoction":"Use this ability with caution, as it can easily get you killed. Make sure to have good timing and a reliable back-up, in case you don't make the throw.
It's extremely good for getting early gank kills / first blood.",
				"alchemist_goblins_greed":"Leveling this ability first will maximize your farm in the lane. Focus on last hitting creeps to keep the stack going.",
				"alchemist_chemical_rage":"This ability will, when activated:
Enhance your HP and Mana regeneration rate.
Improve your attack speed.
Make you run faster.
Fortunately, this ability is very able to spam. The duration is almost as long as the cooldown, so you can quickly dispatch enemies, farm, defend, and repeat."
