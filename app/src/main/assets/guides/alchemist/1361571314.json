				"power_treads":"Provids extra attack speed ,especially if you had to skip the midas,along with a nice health boost.",
				"hand_of_midas":"IMPORTANT:
Only buy this item if you are able to farm it before the first 10 minutes OR if you are behind on levels and are given space to farm in the jungle/in a lane.Always use it on the creep that gives the most experience until you're high enough level.Preferably around at least level 17.",
