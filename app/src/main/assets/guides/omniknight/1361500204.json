				"omniknight_degen_aura":"Stay close to enemy heroes trying to exit ganks with low hp so the carry can catch up and snatch a kill. Or initiate with your -W- and then run up to the enemy/enemies and keep them slowed until your team reaches them.",
				"omniknight_guardian_angel":"A skill not to be wasted. Save it for teamfights or if needing to backdoor a tower and you lack the tankiness for it."
