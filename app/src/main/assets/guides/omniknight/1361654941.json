		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"ward_observer":"As a support hero, buy a courier or wards.",
				"courier":"As a support hero, buy a courier or wards.",
				"mekansm":"You are a strong, powerful support who don't need no man. But Mekansm is the follow-up to your first ability.",
				"pipe":"Depending on the team line-up (if they are mostly magic casters or not), you may not need Pipe of Insight.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"If you can reach it; go for it. This item may prove to be especially useful if you find that the enemy team is split-pushing and/or a fellow player has strayed from the team.",
				"shivas_guard":"The extra armour should help you against physical carries who focus you specifically down. Also great to prevent fleeing foes with its AOE slow.",
				"vanguard":"Depending on the enemy's line-up, Crimson Guard can be especially useful to keep fragile magic-users on your team alive for a little bit longer. Definitely an item to consider if your team needs it; however Mekansm should be enough.",
				"crimson_guard":"Get Crimson Guard towards the later part of the game where you are needed for team-fights. Omniknight can extend the feeling of his ultimate thanks to Crimson Guard; truly mitigating the amount of physical damage taken.",
				"soul_ring":"Soul Ring works well with Purification to keep your heroes alive and give you mana until you have Arcane Boots.",
				"orb_of_venom":"This works in combination of your passive, Degen Aura, hitting them. It is considerably good if you're playing aggressive.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"Use this when using your ultimate. You take no physical damage thus the armor reduction only really affects the target."

				"omniknight_guardian_angel":"Guardian Angel gives physical immunity, not magical, so spells can still stun and hurt your team for a lot."
