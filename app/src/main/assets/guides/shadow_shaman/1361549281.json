				"shadow_shaman_voodoo":"Great long disable, perfect for ward trapping heroes as it makes their models smaller and easier to trap in.",
				"shadow_shaman_shackles":"2.5 second disable at level 1? Yes, please! Doesn`t scale particularly great though, so is maxed last.",
				"shadow_shaman_mass_serpent_ward":"Use it to push towers or team fight. Don`t be afraid to use it on a single enemy to trap them in between the wards (by using them right on top of the hero). If you manage to successfully ward trap someone who doesn`t have Phase Boots or a Blink-like ability, it guarantees you a kill in most cases."
