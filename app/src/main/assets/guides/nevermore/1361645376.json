				"flask":"Good to start with",
				"bottle":"MANA
This is a must, Nevermore needs to spam and harass midlane with the shadowraze and you'll need mana and rune control for it.",
				"ward_observer":"VISION
Basically on any pubs what you need to think is that your not gonna wait for your team to support so you'll need wards to get early rune control.",
				"tango":"Tangos always needed",
				"tpscroll":"Always carry a TP scroll.",
				"travel_boots":"Only you'll need this for pushing if you want to, Nevermore can kill a creep wave faster with one of his shadowraze.",
				"phase_boots":"SPEED
Phase boots its a good early game build for Nevermore because it gives you damage and the ability to pass through creeps while harassing the lane.",
				"bracer":"SURVIVABILITY
This gives Nevermore the stats to survive.

Note: You can sell this later if your team has drums and proceed to Manta Style.
",
				"black_king_bar":"SURVIVABILITY
Damage and inmunity",
				"greater_crit":"CRITICAL DPS, works awesome with Nevermore",
				"manta":"DPS and SURVIVABILITY
This is a must, Manta Style gives your copies that will do 28% more damage to your single target.",
				"invis_sword":"SURVIVAVILITY & GANKING
Use this if your getting killed too much to escape and take any enemy alone.
",
				"desolator":"DAMAGE
Damage and armor reduction",
				"ancient_janggo":"SURVIVABILITY
This gives Nevermore attack speed and survivability.",
				"ring_of_aquila":"SURVIVABILITY
Nevermore is so squishy at this point you'll need to get this for armor and mana regeneration.
