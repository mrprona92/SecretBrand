		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"ring_of_protection":"You don't want to waste valuable exp and potential gold by running back to base. Also grabbing this at the start leaves the courier open for the other lanes.",
				"ward_observer":"Make sure to ward their pull camp so they can't bring the creep equilibrium near their tower.",
				"tpscroll":"Always have these handy. I tend to keep at least 2 on me at all times.",
				"phase_boots":"These are very important for the extra mobility and early last hit damage.",
				"mekansm":"Buy this before the force staff if you are the dedicated builder otherwise skip this item.",
				"sheepstick":"Build this if your team is very lacking with stuns and crowd control spells. This can be helpful to set up shackle shot as well.",
				"orchid":"Orchid is a great item for the extra attack speed and especially for the mana regen. If you're being asked to semi-carry this item is a must.",
				"force_staff":"Use this to set up shackle shot and to use as an extra escape. Windrunner becomes extremely hard to kill once this is built.",
				"sphere":"If you need survivability or extra insurance then build this. Its especially useful if you are designated to hold a gem.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"If you're at the point where you will need to build this item, chances are their carries are going to have some sort of evasion. This will counter that while giving you a nice damage and attack speed boost."

		{
				"windrunner_shackleshot":"Not the most stable of stuns but it can be very powerful if you latch 2 heroes together. Don't wait for the perfect shackle, just keep throwing them out there if it has a chance to latch.",
				"windrunner_powershot":"If you get harassed hard in lane use powershot to last hit creeps or to harass their team back from a long distance. ",
				"windrunner_windrun":"You need windrun at level 1. Avoid taking as much damage as possible so don't hesitate to activate it when trading hits with the other team.",
				"windrunner_focusfire":"A fairly weak ability early on. Once you can get 2-3 ranks of it then its more worth it. Use this to push towers and if you get an orchid this can pump out a lot of damage quickly."
