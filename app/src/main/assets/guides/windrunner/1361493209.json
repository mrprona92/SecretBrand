				"phase_boots":"Or if you prefer the extra HP, you can get Power Treads instead.",
				"mekansm":"If no one on your team is getting it, consider buying it. You are a utility hero after all :)",
				"sheepstick":"Great item if you are having a good game and have lots of money.",
				"orchid":"If you feel you need to do a bit more damage with your attacks or you need the silence. It comes in nice and cheap.",
				"cyclone":"Relatively cheap item which increases your mana regen by a lot and allows you to land a perfect Powershot.",
				"force_staff":"Core item as you need to be able to position yourself for Shackleshot, also chase and escape. Could be replaced by a Blink Dagger.",
				"rod_of_atos":"If you need some extra HP."

				"windrunner_shackleshot":"If you are in fear you might get killed early, grab a point in this at level 2, rather than waiting until 4. It hinders your damage output however, as you will have a lower level in your Powershot until level 4.",
				"windrunner_powershot":"Your only nuke, should be maxed asap. It is also a defensive mechanism - you can use it to get last hits and harass from afar without endangering yourself.",
				"windrunner_windrun":"Primary escape, should get it first in 99% of the games.",
				"windrunner_focusfire":"Mainly useful late game and to destroy towers. Early points in it are a waste most of the time."
