REMEMBER, YOU CAN FIRE YOUR SPIRITS WHILE FLYING TOO!",

REMEMBER, YOU CAN USE THIS WHILE ICARUS DIVING.",

				"phoenix_supernova":"A massive distraction that can ultimately turn the tide of team fights. Your goal is to screw up the enemy's carries and then get away with it. KEEP IN MIND, it takes a CERTAIN NUMBER OF ATTACKS to break this. Feel free to use this when necessary, as it has a relatively low cooldown."
