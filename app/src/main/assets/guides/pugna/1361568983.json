				"mekansm":"Mekansm makes Pugna's pushing capabilities an even stronger affair with a great heal and armour donation to the Pugna organization.",
				"dagon":"Dagon works well with your Decrepify and helps the team finish off some heros. If you feel your team is not dealing the damage needed, consider Dagon.",
				"necronomicon":"This item works great to add further mana drain and damage when channeling your ultimate. We want this to further team's early-game pushing capabilities.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"At an incredible range, no cooldown and increased life/mana steal. Aghanim's makes an effort to kill Pugna a very tried affair. Stay far away, use Decrepify to protect yourself or cripple enemies, and start taking their soul!",
				"shivas_guard":"Shiva's Guard is great for enemies that get too close; also for keep Pugna alive and his enemies' within range for his Nether Blast.",
				"ancient_janggo":"For added chasing ability in case casting Nether Blast would not quite reach your foe."

				"pugna_nether_blast":"This ability has a large area-of-effect and works great on towers. Use it accordingly with Decrepify to really deal extensive damage.",
				"pugna_decrepify":"Leveling Decrepify only increases its duration. Keeping it at level 1 is sufficient for most of the game.

Decrepify works on structures to prevent physical attacks such as Tombstone from Undying and your own Nether Ward!",
				"pugna_nether_ward":"Nether Ward should be used before every team fight, it has a great range so don't hesitate to hide it away from the main fight.",
				"pugna_life_drain":"Use this even if at full life to regain mana. With Aghanim's Scepter, you can be a real annoyance to key players in the game!

Use this on carries and allies to keep them healed at the cost of your own life (and to use Meka at a more crucial time)!"
