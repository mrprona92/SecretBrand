		{
				"phase_boots":"You need to be able to chase heroes down. The extra damage is also great when coupled with Jinada.",
				"vladmir":"Enables your team to take Roshan reasonably early and provides some nice auras. DO NOT get this first if your team is not killing Roshan with it.",
				"ring_of_basilius":"Helpful mana regen and extra armor.",
				"heart":"If you have the money, grab a Heart after 1 or 2 damage items. BKB is still better against magic nukes though. Get a Heart instead only if they have more physical damage and/or little to no disables.",
				"black_king_bar":"It is very likely that you will be focused in fights first. Get a BKB so you don`t die.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"If you are going carry Bounty Hunter, MKB is very useful against evasion heroes. The damage increase is also great.",
				"greater_crit":"You already have a guaranteed crit with Jinada and the 2 don`t stack if proc-ed at the same time.",
				"bfury":"Desolator is better in every regard. Battlefury is for the farming carries - you are a ganker. Don`t get this.",
				"invis_sword":"The extra 150 damage is not multiplied by Jinada and you already have invisibility.",
				"skadi":"Jinada slows, Track makes you fast. Why do you need this?",
				"desolator":"The best damage item on Bounty Hunter - cheap, easy to build and the armor reduction increases your damage output by a lot.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Very helpful stats and makes chasing easier."

		{
				"bounty_hunter_shuriken_toss":"Get this after Jinada. Don`t use it right away in fights, try to wait and stop channeling abilities with its ministun. It costs a lot of mana so only max it first if you have plenty of mana regen items.",
				"bounty_hunter_jinada":"Your bread and butter skill - increases your last hitting power and damage output, as well as slowing the enemy.",
				"bounty_hunter_wind_walk":"Get this first in order to escape sticky situations.",
				"bounty_hunter_track":"Even if you don`t get many last hits in lane, Track will let you catch up extremely quickly just by roaming the map and getting a kill here and there."
