				"bottle":"Get bottle if you find yourself lacking regen early game. Not a usual pickup though.",
				"ward_sentry":"Buy sentries when you suspect the enemy team to buy them against you.",
				"power_treads":"I like Treads better than Phase Boots for the health boost and attack speed boost. I find having no trouble chasing with Jinada and Track to need Phase.",
				"poor_mans_shield":"Good early game item. Some damage, attack speed and a damage reduction from autoattacks.",
				"vladmir":"A great item for Gondar as well as the team. Gives you everything you need, mana regen, armor, damage, lifesteal.",
				"orchid":"Get this item to assassinate THAT mage that keeps stunning and killing your team.",
				"assault":"Armor and attack speed for you and your teammates, armor reduction for the enemies. What's not to love?",
				"black_king_bar":"Get this if their team team has lots of stuns. Also gives some damage and hp. Good item overall.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"A must have if the enemy carry has a Butterfly (counters the dodge chance).",
				"butterfly":"The ultimate carry item. Don't get this if the enemy has a Monkey King Bar.",
				"desolator":"Good damage item, nice armor shredding. I get this item often.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Get this if you have a bad early game and are having trouble farming for the bigger items.",
				"abyssal_blade":"Damage, bash chance and a great two second stun that goes throuch magic immunity. Get only if fairly fed though.",
				"heavens_halberd":"Nice tanky stats, great counter against their damage carry (Disarm prevents them from attacking)"

				"bounty_hunter_wind_walk":"Get two levels before 6, so the duration is longer than the cooldown.",
				"bounty_hunter_track":"One of the best ultimates in the game. Make sure to use it every fight for the extra gold. Useful when chasing and running away because of the speed boost."
