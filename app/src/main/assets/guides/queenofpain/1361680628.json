				"ghost":"If physical carries are giving you problems, ghost scepter is your &amp;amp;quot;Get out of Jail&amp;amp;quot; card.",
				"null_talisman":"These help bolster Queen of Pain's mana pool and her survivability.",
				"sheepstick":"A fast Scythe of Vyse is scary on a ganking hero like Queen of Pain. Keep your foes down and taking all your damage with this item. Generally, this should be your first item to shoot for.",
				"orchid":"Increase your damage and crowd-control with this item. Easy to build, great amplified damage for all your moves and extra attack speed for your decent autoattack output.",
				"dagon":"Early-game dominance? Get a Dagon and keep that lead! Obliterate foes with a combination of your abilities. With Dagon, be sure the gank constantly.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"More damage, but get this after level 11 since it does not affect the damage of your ultimate at level 1 (just the cooldown).",
				"black_king_bar":"When jumping into the fray, Black King Bar should ensure you are not prevented from dealing all that initial damage. A double safety-pin alongside Orchid Malevolence.",
				"sphere":"The stats are good and the protective shell from targetable abilities is always a nice safety measure for Queen of Pain.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"At this point of the game, you pretty much have everything you need. This is to help your autoattack damage output since you have all this attack speed and established magic-damage.",
				"veil_of_discord":"Veil of Discord is pretty good considering your line-up. If you find most of your team are magic-damaging nukers, Veil of Discord is a safe bet."

				"queenofpain_shadow_strike":"Shadow Strike is your slow, due to its consistent mana cost and the extra damage provided from Scream of Pain, it's generally maxed last due to priority.",
				"queenofpain_blink":"Use this to disjoint stuns and ranged attacks. It will disrupt the damage and allow you to avoid danger.",
				"queenofpain_scream_of_pain":"Incredible damage, this nearly kills most frail enemies with your ultimate. Blink in, pop Scream of Pain, then your ultimate and finish fleeing foes with your Shadow Strike.",
				"queenofpain_sonic_wave":"An incredible nuke and a huge range, Sonic Wave is a great item to dish out in team-fights. This should be your follow-up from Scream of Pain."
