		{
				"bottle":"Buy this with the first 600 gold you farmed, it will give you the regen you need at the early game, while improving your gank potential with runes.",
				"power_treads":"The best boots of choise for Queen, it gives you atk speed and stats. You can use it either INT or STR. But STR is best, since u need more HP than MP",

				"sheepstick":"One of the best item in the game, will give you mana to spam your spells and the ability to shut down the enemy carry.",
				"orchid":"Really good cheap item, amazing for countering blinking - invisible - disabler heros, easy to build and good stats.",
				"cyclone":"Good speed bonus, the disable helps your team alot, and may save you many times, since you can use it on yourself and wait the blink CD.",

				"necronomicon":"Really good item, gives you STR and INT, and the abillity to summon 2 demons. Amazing when fighting versus invisible heroes, or mana-dependent heroes.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Gives you nice mana and hp, also status and improves your ult, do it if the enemy team have alot of gold bags, but its also good to push",
				"refresher":"Some people like it. You can get this if you are playing a heavy-caster role, with Scepter and Veil.",
				"black_king_bar":"Amazing item, allow you to do the massive AoE damage you should do in a team fight. Also good HP and damage.",
				"shivas_guard":"More AoE damage, slow, armor and INT. Great item if the enemy team has alot of physical damage.",
				"bloodstone":"I don`t like this item on Queen, but gives you alot of HP-MP and regen.",

				"monkey_king_bar":"When you need some damage. Also counter evasion, perfect late-game item when your enemy may have Butterfly.",
				"greater_crit":"If you wanted to go for Queen of Carry build, this is a amazing item, when you already have 2-3 dps items.",
				"manta":"It`s good vs silencers, but BKB is better.",
				"mjollnir":"You can get this item for carry games since it stack with desolator now. Gives you more AoE damage and good ATK SPD.",
				"skadi":"Late-game item, amazing stats, and the passive slow is also really good, but not needed since you already got Shadow Strike.",
				"desolator":"For me, the start of Queen of Carry build, enjoy whipping the enemy supports ass.",
				"ethereal_blade":"Another for-fun item, allow you to burst down 1 enemy really fast, also you can use it to save an ally.",
				"veil_of_discord":"Just do it if your team have alot of AoE spells, like Epicenter. "
