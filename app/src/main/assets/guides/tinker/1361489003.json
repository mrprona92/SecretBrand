		{
				"blink":"The dagger is a worthy alternative to a force staff so this is left up to personal preference.",
				"gem":"If there are heroes using invisibility to push lanes and escape simply TP in with a gem and kill them while you have surprise on your side.",
				"bottle":"You really want a bottle ASAP so you can zone out your lane opponent with laser+missile. You will need a lot of runes to have the mana to get kills early.",
				"travel_boots":"There is no other boot upgrade on Tinker, Rearm will refresh the cooldown so that you can push/gank, TP back to base, regen and rearm and then jump back to lane in ~10 seconds.",
				"sheepstick":"Scythe is great for ganks and during teamfights you can spam it in conjunction with Rearm.",
				"force_staff":"This great for that extra mobility to get or escape from kills.",
				"dagon":"Dagon is useful early to add power to the Laser/Missile combo.",
				"shivas_guard":"Shiva's is a awesome item for pushing and team fights.",
				"manta":"Manta can be used continuously to push and purge yourself.",
				"ethereal_blade":"Tinker is a squishy hero who doesn't rely on right clicks to do damage so Eth-Blade is an awesome item. Use it on the enemy carry and combo him to death.",
				"soul_ring":"Personal preference as weather to get this or BoTs first. Personally I just get the Travels straight away."

				"tinker_laser":"Use this with Missile to get early kills in the lanes. Does Pure damage so is very powerful.",
				"tinker_heat_seeking_missile":"Use this with Laser to get early kills in the lanes. Cast this after Laser because the range is huge.",
				"tinker_march_of_the_machines":"One of the best pushing skills in the game. TP to creeps, March, Rearm and cast march until you run out of mana and then TP back.",
				"tinker_rearm":"The time you take Rearm is very item dependant. Get lvl 1 just before or as soon as possible after getting BoTs and gank and push globally with them. I usually get lvl 2 when I have ~1000 mana and take lvl 3 when I have ~1500 mana. Remember that Rearm will refresh most item cooldowns too."
