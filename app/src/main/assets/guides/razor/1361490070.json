				"ring_of_protection":"IF YOU DECIDE YOU DON'T WANT TO BUILD BASI BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE IS DOING THAT, GET 2 SLIPPERS FOR SICK DAMAGE OR GAUNTLET+CIRCLET FOR FASTER DRUMS.",
				"tpscroll":"MORE LIKE OP SCROLL",
				"travel_boots":"IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AT SOME POINT.",
				"phase_boots":"YOU GO SLOW UNTIL YOU LEVELED YOUR PASSIVE, ALSO YOUR BASE DAMAGE IS TRASHCAN. GET THIS TO GO FAST AND ZAP LIKE TREANT PROTECTOR. POWER TREADS ARE ALSO LEGITIMATE CHOICE IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING MUCH RUNNING AROUND AND NEED MORE HP, BUT PHASE ARE THE CHOICE OF REAL MEN.",
				"vitality_booster":"GET THIS BEFORE OR AFTER MANTA SO YOU CAN BE ALIVE MORE. DO NOT GET VANGUARD, ONLY SCRUBS DO THAT.",
				"mekansm":"IF YOU'RE PLAYING MID AND THERE'S NO MEK CARRIER ON YOUR TEAM THIS IS SUPER GOOD FIRST ITEM.",
				"pipe":"NOT AS GOOD AS MEK BUT ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU'RE NOT EXPECTED TO BE THE HARDEST CARRY ON YOUR TEAM AND NOBODY ELSE IS BUYING IT WHILE ENEMY TEAM HAS KOTL AND QOP YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO IT.",
				"cyclone":"IN SOME RARE OCCASIONS, A MAN JUST WANTS TO GO EVEN FASTER THAN HE DID BEFORE AND HAVE EASIER TIME BEING A DAMAGE VACUUM (EULING STATIC LINK'S TARGET DOESN'T BREAK THE LINK). HOWEVER, ALL THE STATS BESIDES MOVEMENT SPEED ARE KINDA WASTED SO I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND GETTING IT FOR SHITS AND GIGGLES.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"WITH 6.78 THIS THING IS GOOD. ~3 ZAPS PER SECOND IS STRONG, STATS IT GIVES ARE MOSTLY DECENT AND IT TURNS YOU INTO A PUSHLORD BEAR RAPIST.",
				"refresher":"SEIZURE WARNING. GET THIS ONLY IF YOU GOT AGHANIM'S, NOT WORTH IT BY ITSELF.",
				"heart":"GET THIS IF YOU'RE DYING FAST AND WANT TO LIVE MORE.",
				"black_king_bar":"MAGIC SUCKS",
				"sphere":"IT GOT SOME ADDITIONAL UTILITY WITH THE ADDED ACTIVE BUT IT'S STILL SUPER EXPENSIVE AND SITUATIONAL. GET IT IF THAT BUTTHOLE BATRIDER OR BEASTMASTER MADE IT HIS LIFE GOAL TO ULT YOU. ALSO SHIELD TEAMMATES FROM PROJECTILES LIKE YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL PLAYER.",
				"vanguard":"OH YOU WANT TO LIVE MORE? THEN A GODDAMN VITALITY BOOSTER YOU NERD, DON'T WASTE ALL THAT MONEY ON A AN ITEM THAT WORKS LIKE SHIT ON YOUR HERO.",
				"rapier":"DEAR GOD",
				"monkey_king_bar":"DODGE SUCKS",
				"butterfly":"GET IT AFTER YOU GOT HEART IF YOU'RE SWIMMING IN GOLD.",
				"greater_crit":"SOMEBODY STOP THIS MAN",
				"manta":"BEST ITEM IN GAME, MAKES YOU GO EVEN MORE FAST AND GIVES YOU LITERALLY EVERY STAT YOU WANT.",
				"invis_sword":"YOU KNOW HOW THIS GOES: LINK, USE THIS GUY AND THEN YOU GET AN EASY FULL DURATION LINK UNLESS YOUR ENEMY IS SMART ENOUGH TO BUY RADARS. IF THEY REFUSE TO DO THAT, THIS ITEM WILL PROBABLY WIN YOU THE GAME.",
				"sange_and_yasha":"AFTER GETTING BUFFED FOR 20 YEARS SNY IS NOW LEGIT ON MANY HEROES, RAZOR INCLUDED. GET IT INSTEAD OF MANTA IF YOU LIKE GOING EVEN FASTER AND THERE ISN'T ANYTHING YOU NEED TO DISJOINT.",
				"satanic":"PROBABLY THIS. ALTERNATIVELY, IF YOU SOMEHOW ONLY HAVE 4 SLOTS FILLED, GET BOTH.",
				"skadi":"IF YOU DON'T GET DESO AND IT'S 60 MINUTES IN, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU WISH FOR?",
				"desolator":"IF YOU'RE NOT DYING FAST THEN GET THIS SO YOUR ENEMIES DIE FASTER.",
				"yasha":"EVEN MORE MORE GOING FAST",
				"ancient_janggo":"MORE HP, MORE GOING FAST GET THIS INSTEAD OF AQUILA IF YOU WANT TO GO FASTER INSTEAD OF CASTING MORE.",
				"rod_of_atos":"SIMILARLY TO EUL'S, THIS KID GIVES YOU AN EASIER TIME STRIPPING THEM NERDS OF THEIR DAMAGE, BUT INSTEAD OF SPEED PROVIDES A SICK CHUNK OF HP. STILL, YOU'RE WASTING 2K GOLD ON A STAT THAT YOU DON'T REALLY NEED, SO I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND GETTING IT UNLESS YOU'RE HELLBENT ON NOT MAKING A HEART.",
				"heavens_halberd":"SOMETIMES A MAN JUST WANTS TO STOP THAT GODDAMN BEAR FROM KILLING HIS WHOLE TEAM AND PREVENTING HIM FROM GOING FAST. DODGE IS OKAY AND (SOMETIMES) SLOW IS ALSO OKAY.",
				"ring_of_aquila":"YOU HAVE 3 ACTIVE SPELLS AND YOU ALSO WANT SURVIVABILITY AND DAMAGE, GET THIS MOTHER HUGGER AND IT WILL SOLVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS (KINDA)."
