		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"blink":"One very important core item. This allows you to blink in and immediately silence the enemy + hold them in place with your ultimate.",
				"mantle":"When you are mid (hopefully) you can think about skipping a mantle for a fast bottle.",
				"bottle":"Puck is a mid hero and can control runes very easily - thats why bottle is your friend.",
				"mekansm":"This is situational of course. Puck is a good Mek carry since he has a quite high mana pool.",
				"sheepstick":"Hex is a great item for puck as it allows you to burst down heroes that may otherwise escape.",
				"cyclone":"With Eul and Blink dagger you are almost unkillable. If the enemies have a lot of disables you could consider this (or as a cheaper alternative for hex).",
				"dagon":"If you want to go all out damage - this item is not a bad choice.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Not very common - but the bonus stat and improved ultimate can be worth the money.",
				"shivas_guard":"Shiva synergises very well with puck. With his blink abilities he can ensure to hit a lot of enemies with shivas blast. The other attributes (mana+int) help him as well.",
				"arcane_boots":"Since puck is very maneuverable with his orb - boots don't have a very high priority. BUT if you have mana issues you should definitely get arcanes quite early."
