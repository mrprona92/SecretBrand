				"gauntlets":"Stats! Lich is pretty squishy, you get a little advantage to have this, staying in your lane and resist some harras.",
				"branches":"Branches! Branches are the most costeffective item ingame. Early extrastats give you more healthpoints and more manapoints.",
				"boots":"Movementspeed - better  positioning and you will die less.",
				"flask":"Healing! Always nice to have.",
				"ward_observer":"Wards giving your sight. With wards you can support your carry hardly, have vision about enemy movement, can see runes, and know when to move agressive or more defensive.",
				"tango":"Tangoes give you mendatory regeneration of HP. You can stay longer in your lane and support your carry.",
				"courier":"Get a courier. It is mendatory. If you already have a courier in your team, buy wards!",
				"power_treads":"As beginner I recommend to buy powerthreads. You get a lot sustain against all damage, while they are red and setted to strenght.",
				"mekansm":"Meka gives you and your team all 40 seconds a heal. And the Aura supports in Teamfights aswell.",
				"flying_courier":"From an upgraded courier - as early as possible - will greatly benefit to your midlane. And your little fella will be less sniped off.",
				"buckler":"The buckler gives you some more armor, which gives you some resistance against autoattacks from enemy heroes. After you finished it, buy your complete Mekanism.",
				"pipe":"Many nukers? Get a pipe! It blocks 400 damage from spells.",
				"force_staff":"A Lifestealer locks you hardly down? You die more often, because you're slowed to death?
Push yourself out of position. Or maybe a teammate. ",
				"necronomicon":"Your team is lacking of pushing power? Or you have some trouble with inivisible heroes like Riki or Nyxassasin?
This item is bricked. You get two small units, if they kill the melee-red one, they receive a maximum of 400 pure damage. And they burn mana. And give you slightly faster movementspeed.",
				"shivas_guard":"Many Carries? Slow them down, and have more armor to survive their attacks!",
				"ancient_janggo":"Being dead often? Feeling slow?
Get a drum. Helps you a lot out!",
				"medallion_of_courage":"This item gives you a bit manaregeneration, that you don't really need, but some more armor. This is really useful, when you/re fearing autohits from enemies.",
				"veil_of_discord":"Veil and enemies sticked together is a pure win, You will totally destroy them."

				"lich_frost_armor":"Bonusarmor is a strong thing for your carry. Don't use autocast, it only will empty your manapool over time and you are always aware to care about your best friend - your carry.
You can also use it on melee-creeps, because it's slowing down the enemy range-creeps. And you get more pushing-power!",
				"lich_dark_ritual":"Eat your first range-creep, when the timer starts at 0:00. This decreases the pushing-power of your lane.
And then always sacrifice a creep whenever you can. Try to take only the melee-ones with the most healthpoints.",
				"lich_chain_frost":"So, there aren't many creeps around your enemies, who stick together?
Fire your ultimative skill in them."
