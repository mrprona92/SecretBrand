		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"blink":"Blink to gank your opponent and then Flaming Lasso and activate Firefly.",
				"branches":"Branches are to help alleviate some of the last-hitting difficulty due to Batrider's weak attack damage.
",
				"boots":"Generally Batrider doesn't take advantage of any boots. Tranquil is accepted, but in general; you won't need anything beyond standard boots.",
				"travel_boots":"Late into the game, Batrider will want a pair of boots that will let him push other lanes, jump on foes relatively fast and be able to maneuver quickly with Firefly.",
				"phase_boots":"Due to his weak attack damage, phase boots become a valid item to consider given the extra damage and increase speed needed during the early stages.",
				"cyclone":"Keep foes in place to better initiate on them or to single out a specific enemy for further pounding.",
				"force_staff":"Go farther and faster with this Force Staff. You're using Blink Dagger to reach your opponent, but you want Force Staff to bring the opponent back with you via Flaming Lasso.",
				"black_king_bar":"Prevent your people disrupting your initiation with Black King Bar. This is an item that can really give you favour as you are heavily relied on for initiation.",
				"sphere":"Both great for yourself or your allies, Linken's Sphere is becoming a widely accepted for its stats and Spell Block ability.",
				"arcane_boots":"Though not always necessary, best bought after blink dagger and before Force Staff (to take advantage of Tranquil's disassemble for the Ring of Regeneration).",
				"rod_of_atos":"Rod of Atos can be an item great for in a pinch where someone is known for fleeing quite fast and away and the range for Rod of Atos makes ganking much easier.",
				"tranquil_boots":"The extra movement speed and added regeneration effect is great for a roaming Batrider during the early levels."

		{
				"batrider_sticky_napalm":"Use the low cooldown and cheap mana cost to harass your opponent in lane. Follow this up with regular attacks and watch how fast your opponent will feel incapable in-lane.",
				"batrider_flamebreak":"Great farming tool in the late-game, however Flamebreak works quite well to prevent foes from running, pushing off cliffs and keeping them with AOE damage.",
				"batrider_firefly":"Use Firefly to escape or to cause trouble in team-fights. Once activated, you can go over hills, through trees and into team-fights with this.

Firefly works best after using Flaming Lasso as the opponent will take damage in any direction you take him.",
				"batrider_flaming_lasso":"Wrangle them and activate Firefly. Its range is quite short, so be sure to be very close to your opponent before trying to activate it."
