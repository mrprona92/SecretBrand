				"black_king_bar":"You need Black King Bar to ensure you can nail down all of your damage during God's Strength's duration.",
				"greater_crit":"Daedalus works great with Great Cleave, start building Crystalys first for the small critical damage. This stacks with your ultimate: God's Strength so the damage will be even further.",
				"armlet":"Between this or Mask of Madness are both ideal.",
				"mask_of_madness":"Need that extra movement and attack speed? Snag this quickly to really nail down your opponents faster than they can react."
