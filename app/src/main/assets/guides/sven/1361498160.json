				"heart":"This makes you pretty tanky.",
				"black_king_bar":"You do lots of damage with your ult, so going first item BKB is nice because it allows you to get off your abilities uncontested and do lots of DPS.",
				"greater_crit":"you oneshot people!",
				"armlet":"Nice build up, good stats, the active allows you to do some cool (or clowny) things.",
				"mask_of_madness":"The DPS increase you get from this insane, it has good synergy  with your abilities and BKB.",
				"ancient_janggo":"If you're doing poor in the early game going bracer -> drum can be helpful.",
