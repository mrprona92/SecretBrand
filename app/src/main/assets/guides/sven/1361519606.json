				"clarity":"Mana regeneration is pretty important since it can help you in many situations such as after getting first blood, or after escaping using the stun ability, and because sven's mana pool is very low getting one is very essential in the case you want to TP out or cast the stun again.",
				"flask":"Do not hesitate to pick these up, even in mid game, they are very good and heal 400 hp very fast.",
				"tango":"Regenration items are one of the most important early game, so be sure to pick either Tango or Healing salve, i would recocmend tango.",
