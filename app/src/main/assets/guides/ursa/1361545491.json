				"heart":"*Get this if you don't want BKB.
       Heart gives lots of HP. With higher HP, Ursa's ulti would be so much more powerful. At 3000 HP, the ulti makes the damage go up to +400 which is really powerful to take down enemies instantly",

* not necessary if enemy team doesn't have annoying disabler",
				"blade_mail":"Get this if enemies got a lot of damage dealers",
				"monkey_king_bar":"Only get if enemy team got heroes that can dodge attacks.",
				"basher":"* Must have item for late game

Get this after shadow blade if the enemy team doesn't have many disablers. With ursa's overpower attack speed, Skull basher would prevent any enemy from escaping.",
				"lesser_crit":"Get this after Skull Basher / BKB. This gives you a way higher damage and faster kills.",
				"invis_sword":"* Must have item

Some people choose blink over shadow blade. However, I truly believe that shadow blade is a much better choice. Unlike blink, you can get close to the enemy without them seeing you anywhere and you get an instant kill.
           *Read blink description for more information  "
