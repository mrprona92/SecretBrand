		"AbilityTooltips":
		{
				"witch_doctor_paralyzing_cask":"One of the most annoying spells in the game. Cask and Maledict, coupled with another disable usually result in a kill in the early/mid game (most effective between levels 7-16).",
				"witch_doctor_voodoo_restoration":"You don`t really have the mana to support this early game. Moreover, Witch Doctor is more of an offensive hero than a defensive one. This means that your offensive skills are generally better early/mid game. If you don`t have any mana regen items, it might be worth considering getting stats instead.",
				"witch_doctor_maledict":"Amazing curse! Should be maxed asap. Enemies pop left and right after being hit with Maledict and Death Ward. Make sure you use Maledict before you put the ward down though.",
				"witch_doctor_death_ward":"Nothing to say here - put it down and play some Skrillex."
