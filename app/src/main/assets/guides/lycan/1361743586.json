				"lycan_summon_wolves":"You can get a level of wolves first or get a level of feral impulse first. I prefer to get feral impulse first if I am laning for the first few levels or so.

At level three, your pushing power has become reasonable

Wolves can be used to scout an area and sometimes serve as makeshift wards of sort.",
				"lycan_howl":"Activate this all the time. Activate it even when it gives you no personal benefit. When your team is on the other side of the map fighting, pushing or what have you, activate it.",
				"lycan_feral_impulse":"Having this attack speed is very important for your jungling career.

You can get a level of wolves first or get a level of feral impulse first. I prefer to get feral impulse first if I am laning for the first few levels or so.
",
				"lycan_shapeshift":"For the earlier part of the game, you want to keep this as an escape and tower-pushing tool. Use it as the tower is about to fall.

Also great for team fights."
