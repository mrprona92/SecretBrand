				"ward_observer":"As a support hero, be sure to pick up a courier or wards.",
				"courier":"As a support hero, be sure to pick up a courier or wards.",
				"mekansm":"Mekansm can be an acceptable pick-up for Ogre Magi if your team lacks support heroes.

However, Ogre Magi tends to stay in the back of the fights and there are plenty of items that he could take advantage of.",
				"urn_of_shadows":"Urn of Shadows gives even further capability for Ogre to roam around and snag some kills with his great stun!",
				"cyclone":"Use Eul's Scepter of Divinity to improve Ogre Magi's waddle-like movement and further add to his disabile arsenal.",
				"force_staff":"For escaping or engaging. Use Force Staff to get in range for your Fireblast.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Aghanim's Scepter is the next sensible item for Ogre and pretty much the last of what he needs.

The extra stun multicasts as well, giving you a chance for more damage, more crowd-control for Ogre Magi.",
				"orb_of_venom":"Snag this early if you want to be a continued nuisance during the early phase of the game.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Drums of Endurance gives Ogre Magi further maneuverability and survivability. Not bad given its price.",
				"veil_of_discord":"Veil of Discord is overall a particulary strong item for Ogre Magi's nuke-heavy damage and damage-over-time effects.",
				"rod_of_atos":"Rod of Atos gives a bigger mana pool for Ogre Magi and more life. Its active ability's range to slow enemies is quite good given how much Ogre Magi wants to stay out of fights."

				"ogre_magi_bloodlust":"At a constant 75 mana cost, this ability is great for carries and heros who do physical damage. Use it plenty of times.",
				"ogre_magi_unrefined_fireblast":"Make sure to time your two stuns (Fireblast and this one) to maximize the duration.",
				"ogre_magi_multicast":"Marry Lady Luck to increase likelihood of this working."
