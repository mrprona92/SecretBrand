				"ward_sentry":"Commonly used if they have an invisible person in the lane OR you want to counter ward the enemy team
",
				"courier":"If you're the only teams support you should purchase both wards and the animal courier, however if there is another buy one and let the other support get the other",

				"force_staff":"Force staff is a very strong items for fights as it can get team mates out of the fight when they're on very low HP, just remember this pushes them the direction they are FACING, so try not to force staff them even further into the enemy team.

				"bloodstone":"Get this if you have enough money for it, however normally you should be focusing on other items first.
",
				"arcane_boots":"These boots are essential on Ogre Magi as it'll allow you to continually use spells and replenish your team mates mana pools.",

				"veil_of_discord":"Get this item if you  have a lot of magic damage on your team, and if you don't it can still be a very good item to pick up."
