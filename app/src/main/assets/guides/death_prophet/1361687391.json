		{
				"ghost":"If the enemy team is mostly physical heroes, this might help you out of jam, otherwise skip it.",
				"phase_boots":"With Phase Boots, you can avoid being trapped from creeps, freely trail enemies and keep within distances for your ultimate to deal damage and avoid any direct damages to yourself.",
				"mekansm":"Get Mekansm to provide more survivability for yourself and to help your team since you will always be in the middle of the fight.",
				"cyclone":"Great movement speed and a way to keep you out of danger while your ultimate does its job. Use this for getting out of jams and watch everyone falls as you spin in a cyclone safely.",
				"shivas_guard":"Shiva's Guard is to keep enemies near and to provide further protection for yourself. Keep foes trapped within your area as your ultimate rains chaos.",
				"bloodstone":"Bloodstone is core on Death Prophet due to her demand for health regeneration and because it helps keep Exorcism up for as long as possible.",
				"arcane_boots":"Be sure to disassemble these boots when building Blood Stone.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Another issue Death Prophet has is keeping up with her speedy foes. Drums is to help even the difference out for a cheap cost and some survivability.",
				"rod_of_atos":"Enemies you want to keep within your ultimate, Rod of Atos can be situationally good; especially for frail heroes that can cast from far away. If you find yourself being aggressive as Death Prophet, Rod of Atos can be justified."
