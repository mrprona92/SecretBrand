				"stout_shield":"If you find yourself being harassed during the early-game, a stout shield should put an end to it.",
				"assault":"Reduce everyone's armor so your illusions deal even more damage. Overall, this makes your army of illusions faster and stronger.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"Only buy for evasive heroes.",
				"manta":"With Manta style, you're doubling your ultimate's ability and thus, more critical strikes!",
				"armlet":"Be sure to activate Armlet before using Phantasm. The illusions get the bonus strength damage.",
				"soul_ring":"This is situational item depending how difficult your early-game is. Your mana pool is quite low during the early-phase and the game and if you're find yourself in a good position to snag some early kills or to be more defensive with the stuns and regen - pick this up.",
				"ancient_janggo":"We get drums for added chasing power and the extra free intelligence.",
				"heavens_halberd":"Keep foes down and you evading attacks with Heaven's Halberd. In most cases, this is an ideal item, but not always necessary."

		{
				"chaos_knight_chaos_bolt":"Reality Rift before Stunning because of the range difference and due to the min-stun animation of reality rift. The stun duration for this ability is completely random, but the damage is the inverse of the stun.",
				"chaos_knight_reality_rift":"Reality Rift has a better range than Chaos Bolt. Consider it first before using Chaos Bolt to keep your opponent near you for attacks.",
				"chaos_knight_phantasm":"Combined with your Critical Strike, Phantasm will dish out even more damage than at level 6 alone. Due to its mana cost, you do not get this ability until around level 11."
