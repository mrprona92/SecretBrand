		{
				"ring_of_protection":"Early armor and it allows for a quick build into Ring of Basillius or tranquil boots from the sideshop.",
				"magic_wand":"Only 2/3 of the RoA, Wand, and Drum should be built. ",
				"phase_boots":"Preferred boots if the lane is going well. It's a good boost to flak damage.",
				"black_king_bar":"If the other team has 3+ stuns then this should be rushed immediately. Adds good damage and some survivability. If the other team has poor disables, this can be diregarded in favor of a quick manta/MKB.",
				"rapier":"Because flak cannon scales hardest with flat damage, Divine rapier is actually a viable choice on him. In the late game, a divined Gyro can 1v5 entire teams. Please don't buy unless you have BKB/Aegis.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"Synergizes well with Flak Cannon because it benefit from high damage.",
				"butterfly":"High damage and a great pickup if dealing with multiple carries on the other team.",
				"manta":"Very money efficient item. Remember to use the active to break slows and other soft CC.",
				"invis_sword":"If other team has poor detection or you find yourself needing to kite melee carries, this item works. Keep in mind you can turn on rocket barrage and then go invisible!",
				"satanic":"Build after either Manta/MKB. Do not buy until your 5th or 6th item. Remember the active!",
				"helm_of_the_dominator":"Can be grabbed before BKB if having a good early game.  Dominate a creep and start stacking ancients. Keep in mind that lifesteal does not apply to the extra projectiles in flak cannon.
With the new 6.78 nerfs to Flak, you should only do the ancient when 3 or 4 stacked because of the time required",
				"yasha":"Decent on it's own, it should eventually be built into manta. The movespeed helps early on for chasing heroes with rocket barrage and getting better positioning.",
				"ancient_janggo":"If you need immediate health in a rough lane, pick up the drum.

Only 2/3 of the RoA, Wand, and Drum should be built. ",
				"ring_of_aquila":"Remember to finish the basilius at the side shop early on. Finish the aquila after basic boots.

Only 2/3 of the RoA, Wand, and Drum should be built. ",
				"tranquil_boots":"Useful in a rough lane if suffering a lot of harassment.

If you're going to be using flak less often in lane, then these boots are preferred."

		"AbilityTooltips":
		{
				"gyrocopter_rocket_barrage":"One of the best DPS skills in the game. For best effect, attempt to peel heroes away from creep waves so that rockets aren't wasted.

If you have a support who can CC, try to play aggressive early.",
				"gyrocopter_homing_missile":"One point wonder. Used mostly for the CC and to force heroes into running where you can get them seperated for rocket barrage.
",
				"gyrocopter_flak_cannon":" Scales off of damage which is why Phase/Helm/BKB are so good on him. Remember you can shoot at creeps in order to extend the range and harass heroes much further away.

Because of nerfs, you must decide between flakking the lane or the jungle. Use wisely.

Only the main attack uses modif'iers.",
				"gyrocopter_call_down":"Used often as an initiation, try to predict the path of heroes because of it's cast time.

It can also be used while retreating because of the slow affect, just throw it on top of yourself before running back,.",
				"attribute_bonus":"Gyro needs stats badly because of his squishy nature and poor range.
