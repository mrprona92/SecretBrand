		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"phase_boots":"Damage and speed is what Gyrocopter needs. While the early-game may be a bit difficult to survive, towards the late-game, these boots may prove their worth.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Get Aghanim's to counter-push waves you cannot reach or to help out in ganks or fights you're not near enough to participate in.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"We rush Monkey King Bar for the damage in combination with your Flak Cannon. Monkey King Bar is among the best items for rush damage and works properly with Flak Cannon.",
				"butterfly":"Evasion and Attack Speed are key elements to wrapping up Gyrocopter's ability to destroy teams fast.",
				"greater_crit":"Daedalus, while the critical doesn't spread across with your Flak Cannon, does give direct damage and effect to your main target.",
				"invis_sword":"Shadow Blade works amazingly well with Gyrocopter in combination with his Rocket Barrage. Cast Rocket Barrage, move at an incredible speed while freely taking down your foes.",
				"satanic":"Though a great item for life-steal, it will take a backseat to your more extension damage-dealing items.",
				"helm_of_the_dominator":"Stack ancients with Helm of the Dominator. You are going for late-game, so you will need those Ancients for a lot of your Extension Items",
				"yasha":"If someone got drums, Yasha is a decent alternative, albeit offering a bit less in terms of stats.",
				"arcane_boots":"Consider replacing this with Phase Boots for the added chasing ability or if you feel you do not need the mana.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Some survivability and extra speed is nothing to shy away from as Gyrocopter. Get Drums of Endurance to help you farm better and safely.",
				"ring_of_aquila":"Aquila gives you the survivability you need to avoid harass and a little extra damage to make last-hitting much easier.",
				"tranquil_boots":"Disassemble later to make Treads."

		{
				"gyrocopter_rocket_barrage":"Rocket Barrage is your self-defensive item that can also be used within the first few levels to snag a first-blood as it is incredible damage when it targets a specific enemy (and away from creeps).",
				"gyrocopter_homing_missile":"Homing Missile works great as a setup for future ganks and has a range that rivals many other stunners. Use Homing Missile as your allies are about to stun so enemies are notified of the incoming death.",
				"gyrocopter_flak_cannon":"Flak Cannon can also be a good way to farm lanes early in the game if preferred to max first. It has an incredible range (farther than your regular attack) and can be a safe way to last-hit units.",
				"gyrocopter_call_down":"This is your initiation AFTER STARTING HOMING MISSILE and has a great range to cast for Gyrocopter.

It's initial slow can keep foes in range to start your Flak Cannon and at a movement speed you can easily keep on a leash."
