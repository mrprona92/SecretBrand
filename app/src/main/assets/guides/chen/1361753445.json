				"ultimate_scepter":"Maybe its not so cool item for you, cuz it cost too much. And its true. But (!) Im playing a really loooong time, and i can say that if you have an aghanim, bloody, scepter, its 99% you won the game.",

",

3) dont forget about delay. use it wiser. (on lvl 4 its 3 seconds) ",
