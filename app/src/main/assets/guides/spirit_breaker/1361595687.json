				"spirit_breaker_charge_of_darkness":"At level 1, use Charge of Darkness to escape and make your way across map. It is not meant to be used to gank until you get your ultimate. You have the choice to either max this or Empowering Haste, depending how you prefer to play this hero. After charge, you will perform your passive: Greater Bash",
				"spirit_breaker_empowering_haste":"Empowering haste is pretty good if you want the damage over the speed of Charge of Darkness. With this maxed out after Greater Bash, you will deal more damage in single engagements.

Activate this ability to increase your damage right after your hit someone with your charge.",
				"spirit_breaker_greater_bash":"We are maxing our Greater Bash first as it is guaranteed after Charge of Darkness and thus, more damage upon each gank. Your ultimate also offers you a Greater Bash, giving you two greater bashes at level 6 and thus more bonus damage.",
				"spirit_breaker_nether_strike":"Follow-up your Charge of Darkness with this ultimate ability to extend the stun duration. It does go through Black King Bar. However, be wary that there is a delay while casting where you will not be immune to disables."
