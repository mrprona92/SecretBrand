				"blink":"You can also grab this after armlet for some pack of initiations. If you position yourself with these, your 2nd skill can stun up to 3 enemies!
It's pretty nifty to control enemies in a certain area, think it like how centaur does it.",

Going Carry? Grab one tango and both this and shield.",

				"hood_of_defiance":"This thing gives you regen, and protects you from those pesky wizards.",
				"greater_crit":"This is one situational pick if you're balling, It gives nothing but raw damage, i'd suggest to invest money in much better items, but this' worth a call.",

				"lesser_crit":"Your punches aint enough for you? Grab this sword.",
				"armlet":"This thing gives so many punches on your attack. Be careful at the hp drain as usual.",
				"invis_sword":"Although not mentioned on the main build grabbing these can get you outta dangerous situation, one click at a time.",
