Try to level this up early as this skill is the most important. Without this skill Huskar is almost as useless. This skill coordinates with Crystalys and Daedalus. Causing critical hits to be more successful with increased attack speed. This skill also coordinates perfectly with MKB as Huskar has no disabling abilities. This skill is also good when you are getting harassed during the laning phase as you can either harass them back with increased attack speed or farm and deny with increased attack speed. Remember: this skill also gives a huge amount of magic resistance which makes magic damage very hard to kill Huskar when he is in low health.","huskar_life_break":"This skill is what makes Huskar a great hero during mid game. Also without this skill, your third skill would not really trigger quickly. Remember: try not to use this skill if the opponent has blademail on or bkb. It is useless as it doesn\u0027t benefit at all. You should be able to gank and kill once this skill is acquired. Use first skill before using this.","huskar_burning_spear":"Leveling this up allows you to harass constantly. Do not autocast this in early levels as it reduces your health very fast. Throw fire spear by fire spear at enemy heroes. Try not to use this skill in the early game. Autocast this skill when ready for ulti. Spam fire spear after using ulti. Remember to control your health too. Remember: this skill stacks and every fire spear burn damage overtime, therefore estimate your enemy heroes health and stop throwing spears when you think the fire spears is enough to burn your enemy to death. Probably when your enemies are at 10% health threshold. This is because continuous fire spear throwing may result you in denying yourself or getting killed by someone else. After getting lifesteal, you can probably use this more often.","huskar_inner_vitality":"Get levels of this at mid game since this skill is of not much use at early levels, this skill is only useful starting at level 3. Moreover, this skill is requires some amounts of mana, so its not suitable during early game use and leveling this up early prevents you from leveling other skills which are much more useful. Use tangos or healing salve to recover instead. Some players make mistake by leveling this skill up early thinking that this skill regens health fast. Players must know that this skill is only use optimumly at levels 3-4. Remember to use this skill on your allies too during mid game. Its an extremely useful skill. Most important is to use this skill before using ulti.","attribute_bonus":"Get this during the later stage of the game as you dont require bigger mana pool or more health or stats during early game."}},"Hero":"huskar","ItemBuild":{"ItemTooltips":{"gauntlets":"For some early game regen and tankiness","lesser_crit":"As your attack speed increases everytime you lose health when using ulti, damage done is very high with critical.","lifesteal":"To gain health from lost health from ulti and burning spears.","hood_of_defiance":"For more regen and more magic resistance.","greater_crit":"Increases damage, critical multiplyer and critical chances, making it easier to kill.","black_king_bar":"Makes you invulnerable to stuns and magic damage.

Most people escapes easily by teleporting when huskar ganks them. Now with this item, its almost guarantee you can face enemy heroes 1v1 without them escaping. Basher may not be so suitable as it only gives 10% chance to bash. Moreover this item increases damage and prevents huskar from missing attacks to heroes like Phantom Assasin and heroes with butterfly.","heart":"Gives amazing amount of regen and tankiness. ","heavens_halberd":"Disables  the opponents carry who deals a lot of physical damage to you especially heroes like Ursa, SF, riki and many many more as physical damage is kind of your weakness. ","assault":"If u have a decent amount of magical resistance since you have your third skill, why don\u0027t you go for more armour as it reduces physical attacks? Assault is the best way to increasing ur armour as it not only increases armour but it increases attack speed. Furthermore giving your allies aura.","ultimate_scepter":"This item is very useful.
