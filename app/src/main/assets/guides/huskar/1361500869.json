				"huskar_berserkers_blood":"The more wounded you are, the faster you will hit, and the more magic resist you will get.",
				"huskar_life_break":"Great spell for taking out single enemies or to extract some of your Health to get more stacks on your passive.

Despite people using it to initiate, ONLY do this if you're going against one. If you're in a teamfight, use this spell when you're half HP or lower, or else you will just kill yourself."
