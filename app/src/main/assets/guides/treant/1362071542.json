				"tango":"Donate one of the tangos if your lane isn`t extremly contested.",
				"vladmir":"Just if noone has AC on your team.",
				"force_staff":"Keep in mind that you can force allys to trees while \"guising\" them.",
				"heart":"Just if you're sure that they can't ignore you once it's up.",
				"black_king_bar":"SITUATIONAL ITEM. Buy it just if your opponent team has to be REALLY scared of you ult. Just walk in and force chaos.",
				"blade_mail":"Buy it and literally stand in your opponents way!",
				"arcane_boots":"If you're unlikely to reach them go tranquil + soul ring or just soulring.",
