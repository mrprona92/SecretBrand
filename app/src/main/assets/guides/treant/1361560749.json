		{
				"blink":"A Blink Dagger improves Treant Protector's mobility as well as vastly improving his initiation power with Overgrowth.

Try using Nature's Guise to get into position and blink into the enemy team, locking them in place with Overgrowth!",
				"quelling_blade":"A Quelling Blade can be a fantastic utility for Treant Protector in the right hands. Use this item to clear paths in the forest for allied gank heroes like Pudge or Mirana.

It can also be used to create escape routes and manuever through the trees while under Nature's Guise.",
				"stout_shield":"A Stout Shield starts things off for Treant Protector on the right foot, allowing him to take more punishment during the laning phase. This especially comes in handy if you are laning against ranged or otherwise aggressive foes.",
				"gem":"Because Treant Protector is so tanky and survivable, he is one of the best heroes to have a Gem of True Sight on.

If an enemy Riki or Bounty Hunter is giving your team trouble, this item is worth picking up!",
				"clarity":"During the laning phase, Rooftrellen struggles with a less than stellar mana pool. One Clarity early on helps Treant stay relevant in the lane for longer.",
				"tango":"This first set of Tangos will provide either you or your lane partner with valuable early game health regeneration.",
				"courier":"As a support class, it is your responsibility to make sure your squad has an Animal Courier up and running. If your team already has an Animal Courier, buy some Observer Wards instead!",
				"urn_of_shadows":"Urn of Shadows is a fantastic utility to have when you're racking up assists. The mana regeneration and Strength buff is just a bonus. And for the price, you can't do much better.",
				"headdress":"Headdress provides a relatively cheap way health regeneration aura for your surrounding allies.",
				"cyclone":"If your team lacks a solid disable or is getting wrecked by a single hard carry in teamfights, Eul's Scepter of Divinity can provide a welcome 2.5 second disable.

The added effects it provides are just as sweet--movement speed, Intelligence, and mana regeneration.",
				"necronomicon":"Necronomicon increases Treant Protector's Strength and Intelligence, which is always welcomed. The summons also benefit from auras that Rooftrellen gives off!",
				"refresher":"A Refresher Orb in combination with Rooftrellen's ultimate ability Overgrowth is a devastating combination.

Refresher Orb also comes packaged with great buffs to Treant Protector's Intelligence, damage, and health as well as mana regeneration.",
				"assault":"Assault Cuirass provides survivability for Treant as well as a very nice aura that buffs allied attack and movement speed.",
				"soul_ring":"An early Soul Ring will allow you to spam Leech Seed in the lane which is extremely annoying for enemy heroes to deal with.

The health and mana regeneration are just bonuses!",
				"arcane_boots":"Arcane Boots help not only Treant Protector's own weak mana supply, but are an invaluable utility for his squad all throughout the game.",
				"heavens_halberd":"Adding big-time damage, Strength, and evasion, Heaven's Halberd makes you more of a threat on the battlefield.

The passive ability is perfect for securing kills on fleeing targets and the active ability is perfect to initiate with."

				"treant_natures_guise":"With relatively low mana cost, Nature's Guise is the perfect ability for setting up ganks for teammates or escaping certain death. Using this skill effectively requires good communication with your team.

Note: This spell has a fade time of 2--make sure to cast it before the point of no return!",
				"treant_leech_seed":"Leech Seed is great for harassing enemy heroes during the laning phase. (Especially when paired with a Soul Ring.)

This is also a great ability to initate a gank with, as the 24% slow is usually enough for your allies to jump on the target.",
				"treant_living_armor":"Living Armor is Treant Protector's bread-and-butter ability. With low mana cost and cooldown, you should be casting this spell every time it is available.

Prioritize which towers or allies need healing and check around constantly for anybody in trouble--this skill saves lives!",
				"treant_overgrowth":"Overgrowth is an incredible skill for initiating teamfights. Use Nature's Guise to get in close to the enemy team for best results.

Note: Overgrowth will still trap magic immune targets. However, if magic immunity is activated after Overgrowth is cast, the unit will break free.",
				"attribute_bonus":"I think I added a few rings just now..."
