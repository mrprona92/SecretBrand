OTHERWISE, consider getting more regen instead",
				"stout_shield":"Must have, unless you are going on a trilane against a solo",
				"travel_boots":"Late game boots. Almost must have on 50+ minute",
				"phase_boots":"Some mobility + damage is always good",
				"vladmir":"Lifesteal if you don't plan buying a satanic at the late game, unless one of your teammates has it.",
				"heart":"Makes you even more tanky. Consider getting it ASAP if you don't have an intend on buying a BKB",
				"black_king_bar":"Must have in 95% of games. You need to land your hits, and you are not that tanky to survive several controls in a row in a teamfight.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"Take instead of BF if there is at least one hero with evasion in the enemy team (void excluded, windrunner included) or it's 30+ minute already",
				"bfury":"Good DPS item plus good farming boost",
				"armlet":"Main item of the build. Gives you 500 hp when activated, some regen, and dps. That HP boost will help you A LOT.",
				"satanic":"Makes you way more tanky",
				"helm_of_the_dominator":"Your main lifesteal, consider buying satanic in a lategame. Plus, if you have a BF, stacking your ancients with a dominated creep would be handy.",
				"abyssal_blade":"Buy instead of MKB if you feel that you need some sort of control if there are no heroes with evasion on the other team."
