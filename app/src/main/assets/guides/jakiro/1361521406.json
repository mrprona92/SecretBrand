		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"ring_of_protection":"Buy this now so you can finish your Ring of Basilius at the Side Shop.",
				"branches":"Cheap stats, builds into Magic Wand.",
				"magic_wand":"Cheap stats and the active provides you with much needed mana. Jakiro spends a lot of mana.",
				"ward_observer":"Wards win games. You are a support, buy them.",
				"courier":"Your team requires one. You are a support. Buy it. Otherwise, take a Salve.",
				"mekansm":"Jakiro is an excellent Mekansm carrier because of his natural tankiness. This also helps with pushing and the stats are great on a tanky support.",
				"buckler":"Part of your Mekansm. Build this first for the active ability to buff your lane creeps with Armor. Very useful for pushing lanes.",
				"ring_of_basilius":"Usually a high Intelligence Hero does not need Ring of Basilius (Sage's Mask alone provides more mana). In this build, Jakiro will be pushing lanes... so the Armor aura is very powerful.",
				"sheepstick":"Best item in the game. If you can farm up a Mystic Staff, you can't go wrong with Scythe of Vyse.",
				"cyclone":"Fire, Ice & Wind! Best cheap mana regen item in the game, with a powerful active that can save your life. Sets up Ice Path in skirmishes too.",
				"force_staff":"Good for escaping and saving allies. Can't go wrong with Force Staff.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Worthwhile item to upgrade your ultimate but Veil of Discord is better in almost every way.",
				"shivas_guard":"Usually more worthwhile to get a Scythe of Vyse, but the armor works well with Jakiro and the aura and active are powerful against carries.",
				"arcane_boots":"Jakiro has mana issues, especially once he gets his Ultimate. Every little helps, great team support item too.",
				"veil_of_discord":"Extremely powerful on Jakiro. Every spell you have causes magic damage and this increases it. The stats also tank you up, making you even harder to kill late game.",
				"ring_of_aquila":"Natural upgrade to your Basilius. Free stats for no extra inventory space. Alternatively, disassemble your Basilius and keep the Sage's Mask for another item."

		{
				"jakiro_dual_breath":"One of the highest total damage nukes in the game. It hits in 2 waves.

Massive range and movement slow. Powerful for defending towers, pushing towers and teamfight control.",
				"jakiro_ice_path":"Amazing AoE stun on a tiny cooldown. This build is for pushing, so we only take 1 point until level 12. One of the best follow-up stuns in the game, so use it after your team has initiated for maximum effectiveness.",
				"jakiro_liquid_fire":"SLOWS TOWER ATTACK SPEED! This ability makes your pushes immune to tower damage, which is why you must have Level 4 Liquid Fire as soon as possible in this pushing build.
 
Outside of Towers, use it on enemy carries to heavily reduce their damage output",
				"jakiro_macropyre":"Macropyre > Ice Path > Wait > Dual Breath. Your power combo. Destroys squishies in team fights and is absolutely devastating with abilities like Chronosphere and Black Hole. Wait until Level 10 to skill, as it costs a lot of mana and you do not have the ability to lock down enemies yourself."
