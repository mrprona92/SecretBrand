Notes: Try to stun multiple heroes with one cast, and you can ground-target this for a bit of extra distance.",
				"lion_mana_drain":"With recent range buffs this will effectively prevent almost anyone from getting too close to the creep wave in early laning phase, mid and late game it can be used to disable certain heroes (tide, enig, etc) with low mana pools/high mana costs.

Notes: Kills illusions, good morphling counter.",
				"lion_finger_of_death":"It's good to keep track of exactly how much damage you're capable of, take whatever magical damage you do total and multiply it by .75 (assuming they have no magic resistance items).

For example, with Lvl2 Impale and Lvl1 Finger you'll do 547 damage after base magic armor."
