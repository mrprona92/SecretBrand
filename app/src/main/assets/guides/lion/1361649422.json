		{
				"ghost":"The Ghost Scepter is very usefull, if you face a very high DPS carry, it allows you to dodge the focus on you.
The down side is, if there are any nukes on the enemies side you have to use the scepter wisly, otherwise you die really fast.",
				"ward_observer":"Look at Courier Information",
				"courier":"You need to talk with your support mate ingame, you get courier or wards BUT not both.",
				"flying_courier":"Same thing here 2nd set of wards or flying courier",
				"pipe":"You should get a pipe, if the enemies got many aoe spells and nukes like Epicenter etc.
Mostly heros like DS or Pudge will get a Pipe, you need to communicate if your team to figure out who will buy the Pipe.",
				"urn_of_shadows":"With Lion you can set up easyly kills in early game as soon as you hit lvl 6, an urn will do good work for you and your mates.",
				"orchid":"Orchid is a good choice if you play vs heros whitch are dependent on their spells, like DS, Tidehunter, Enigma etc.
You can shut them down and give your team the time to kill them.",
				"sphere":"Linkens is a defensive item, you should get it to avoid strong single target nukes, such as Laguna Blade or Zeus nukes. Or if you get really hard fokused.
You can avoid buying a Linkens if you manage to position yourself good.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Either Drums or Meka it depense on your mates, what they will buy.",
				"smoke_of_deceit":"To set up kills a smoke will always help",
				"veil_of_discord":"This item will boost your teamfight potential if your team is based on AOE spell dmg.",
				"rod_of_atos":"Rod of Athos is a very underused item. It is very uesfull if the enemie carry is meele. A meele carry needs to stand next to you that he can beat you down. The Rod allows you and your team to make the carry run around  like a chicken and never catch up."
