		{
				"blink":"Catch foes off-guard with Blink Dagger, it will help your ganks so much more and may even save your life once or twice.",
				"ward_observer":"As a support hero, be sure to buy the courier or wards. You can only afford one, so choose appropriately.",
				"courier":"As a support hero, be sure to buy the courier or wards.",
				"mekansm":"We're getting Mekansm as you are a decent holder of the item and desperately need the armor.",
				"force_staff":"Your escape and initation. Building into Force Staff is much easier than Blink, but consider the alternative if it ever comes up as an opportunity.",
				"dagon":"Double the nuking damage, double the kill-stealing with Lion. Though Dagon isn't justified, it can be if you find yourself in a huge advantage as Lion. Other items in Situational may also be preferred in that regard.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"This item works great when you can get someone to set it up such as Dark Seer, Magnus or Enigma as they gather enemies in a small AOE for you to take advantage of.",
				"veil_of_discord":"Great particular item when looking to increase the damage of your casters. Veil of Discord can add to the survivability of Lion; though it is situationally useful as a whole.",
				"tranquil_boots":"Lion needs very little to be in the field. Tranquil's Boots gives him the regeneration and survivability he needs at an easy cost."

				"lion_mana_drain":"Works on creeps and heroes, but requires you to channel. Use wisely where you aren't vulnerable. The range is quite well; so use it whenever possible or even on enemies as your cooldown is low.",
				"lion_finger_of_death":"Use it to tear down carries that are fragile in form but dish out a lot of damage. In most cases, you'll be able to kill them given you follow-up with your other damage-dealing ability: Earth Spike."
