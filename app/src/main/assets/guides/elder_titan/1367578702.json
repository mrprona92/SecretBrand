		{
				"elder_titan_echo_stomp":"A very good spell to engage and make your combo, or even to earn some time waiting for your allies to come and help you. Be careful to not get this ability cancelled while you’re channeling it! You can also use Echo Stomp to put to sleep the enemies chasing you.",
				"elder_titan_ancestral_spirit":"This spell is useful in almost every situation. It deals good damage, has a great range, allows you to use easily your Echo Stomp and is a safe way to scout the map while being completely safe. During team fights, it will also give a high damage bonus.",
				"elder_titan_natural_order":"A neat passive ability, especially while you’ve reached mid game and that the first team fights start. It will enable your whole team to deal more damage, either physical or magical.",
				"elder_titan_earth_splitter":"An impressive ultimate, which deals good damage, even on tanks. It has a long range, but is kinda hard to use efficiently. Try to activate it after you used your Echo Stomp, or when your allies have disabled your opponents.",
				"attribute_bonus":"Stats are your best friends mate!"
