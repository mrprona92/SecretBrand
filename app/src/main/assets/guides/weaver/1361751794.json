				"sphere":"Great damage, conservative item, keeps you alive to let you pull off Time Lapse.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"Evasion heroes despise Monkey King Bar. This item is straight damage and can be key to competing rivaling physical carries.",
				"radiance":"If doing incredibly well, consider getting radiance for Weaver, otherwise, skip it for cheaper damage-dealing items.",
				"butterfly":"Linken's Sphere and Evasion makes Weaver difficult to catch even with True Sight when he casts Shukuchi.",
				"greater_crit":"Tear foes even faster with Daedalus as its critical strike is incredible powerful and great for a fast-moving and damaging hero like Weaver.",
				"maelstrom":"Get Maelstrom for easy kills during your initial levels and for the fast ability to farm your Linken's Sphere. Without Maelstrom, your farm will be massively lower.",
				"desolator":"The armor reduction from this item works alongside your The Swarm ability, making your attack deal even more damage! Geminate Attack  still occurs even if you get Desolator.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"The armor reduction from this item works alongside your The Swarm ability, making your attack deal even more damage! Great if you want to early-game pressure instead of farming for your more core items.",
				"ring_of_aquila":"Ring of Aquila provides easy last-hitting with the small mana regeneration you want to pop your Shukuchi at any time's notice."

This works alongside Desolator's Armor Reduction.",

				"weaver_geminate_attack":"Items with orb effects work alongside this passive ability.",

Use this ability to rewind to a safe location even at full health."
