		{
				"magic_wand":"Entirely optional, if farm is going well just ignore it and go for a straight Perseverance instead.",
				"tango":"With the new 4 stacks of Tangoes, you don`t even need a salve anymore",
				"pers":"Don't forget that the Ring of Health can be picked up from the side shop whereas the Void Stone requires the secret shop.",
				"sphere":"The core of this build, Linkens often gives you just enough time to Time Lapse out of a tricky situation.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"A core item on Weaver whose Geminate attack benefits entirely from the additional damage.",
				"greater_crit":"The increased attacks from Geminate Attack mean even more chance for crits. An interesting alternative if you`re the prime Aegis carrier of the team is a Rapier",
				"desolator":"Whilst the second Geminate Attack doesn`t gain the orb effect, it still benefits hugely from the armor reduction which is very easily stacked on Weaver.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"More of a situational pickup for when farm isn`t going so well, combined with your swarm this ensures huge armor reduction.",
				"ring_of_aquila":"You`ll most likely want to build the Basilius first due to the mana regen and lane pushing ability. Make sure to turn it off when you`re trying to static farm!"

		"AbilityTooltips":
		{
				"weaver_the_swarm":"Hugely underrated, at max level they deal 600 damage if not removed and the armor reduction is critical. Try casting after a teamfight has been initiated so that they don`t draw attention.",
				"weaver_shukuchi":"Your bread and butter escape + damage. Try not to spam it too much at low levels since it can very quickly drain your mana pool.",
				"weaver_geminate_attack":"Your main dps comes from this skill, try and balance levelling it with The Swarm to gain maximum mid game power.",
				"weaver_time_lapse":"An absolute life-saver, use it after you`ve been bursted down in teamfights. If you die in the middle of a fight without using it you can also buyback and instantly use it to get back into the fray."
