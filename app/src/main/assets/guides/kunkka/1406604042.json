		{
				"blink":"At high skill levels, Blink is more valuable than Shadow Blade. You will farm the jungle very quickly. Also, if you cast X on yourself, you can blink deep into a fight and escape safely",
				"stout_shield":"Provides good protection in lane. Sell this after you have sold your Branches when you need to free up an item slot",
				"branches":"Provides cheap early game stats. Sell these off first as you need to free up item slots",
				"bottle":"Rush Bottle and fight hard for Rune control in order to keep your mana and health high",
				"tango":"Stay alive in lane",
				"tpscroll":"Always be prepared to escape danger or help an ally in their lane",
				"travel_boots":"Boots of Travel will allow you to split push, join fights anywhere on the map, and will free up an inventory slot since you will no longer need TP Scrolls",
				"phase_boots":"Get Brown Boots after Bottle and upgrade them to Phase Boots. The speed boost will help you chain early Torrents and Ghost Ships, as the cast distances are different",
				"demon_edge":"You will be building Daedalus. Buy the Demon Edge first and complete the item when you have the rest of the gold you need. Building Demon Edge over Crystalys provides more reliable damage with each attack",
				"pers":"You are rushing Battlefury. Build Perseverance first",
				"heart":"If you play Kunkka well, you won't need a Heart since you won't be focused in fights much. X and Blink should be enough to escape",
				"black_king_bar":"If you are not able to avoid being focused, get BKB before Daedalus",
				"greater_crit":"If you want absurd damage",
				"bfury":"Greatly speeds up farming but also provides very valuable mana regeneration. You will be doing a lot of farming in order to earn your later items"
