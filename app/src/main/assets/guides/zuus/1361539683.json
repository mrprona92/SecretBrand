		{
				"tango":"Zeus is a mid hero and should rush a bottle. Buy these items and save up for the bottle.",
				"sheepstick":"The ultimate item for int heroes -great stats, great mana regen, great disable. If you are not doing very well however, consider getting Euls instead.",
				"cyclone":"If you are not doing so well, consider getting Euls - solves your mana problems and helps you escape.",
				"force_staff":"Your only escape mechanism. Without it you will die... A LOT. Could be replaced by a Blink Dagger.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"One of the best items for Zeus. Usually you want to get this after your Force Staff.",
				"refresher":"Refresher coupled with a Scepter just 2 shots squishies.",
				"bloodstone":"If you are doing extremely well to start off with, consider turning your Arcane Boots into a Bloodstone. ONLY get it if you can afford it before 20mins.",
				"arcane_boots":"The only boots for Zeus (apart from late game Travels I guess). You need the mana capacity and regen to spam your skills.",
				"veil_of_discord":"Very nice if you have other nukers on the team. Wouldn`t recommend it if Zeus is the only one as Veil is expensive and doesn`t provide helpful stats.",
				"rod_of_atos":"For the extra HP. Slow is also nice."
