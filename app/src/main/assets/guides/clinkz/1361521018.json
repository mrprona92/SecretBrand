				"magic_wand":"Early game option for laning phase depending on how often the enemy is casting",
				"power_treads":"Swap your treads to INT when casting your ultimate, both to help offset the relatively high mana cost, and to get more healing out of the ability.",
				"ring_of_basilius":"When you're ready to create your second Oblivion Staff to go into Orchid, split this ring up to use the Sage's Mask.",
				"sheepstick":"Luxury item",
				"orchid":"Rushing Orchid is a must. This item is what allows you to become one of the most feared solo gankers in the game.",

				"monkey_king_bar":"Luxury damage item
",

Before Orchid, we do not have the mana pool to support Strafe, so put it off until the Orchid comes out.",
				"clinkz_searing_arrows":"Wait until you get to lane to determine if you can grab Searing Arrows at level 1 - if you are against a lane that is looking for a level 1 first blood, opt for Skeleton Walk.

This build prioritizes Searing Arrows for the huge damage it gives you early on. Make sure to orb walk!",
				"clinkz_wind_walk":"Wait until you get to lane to determine if you can grab Searing Arrows at level 1 - if you are against a lane that is looking for a level 1 first blood, opt for Skeleton Walk.

We prioritize Skeleton Walk over Strafe. The movespeed/duration bonus allows permanent invisibility and high mobility",
				"clinkz_death_pact":"Most of the time, you want to be eating a large creep in the jungle to get the most out of this ability. We rush mana/intelligence items in order to support casting this ability nearly every cooldown.

Can be used to control lane position for static farming by eating a friendly creep."
