Tip: Activate when you have yasha and the level of split shot is level 3 or 4.",

tips:example, level 2 magic snake hits 4 units. So kill 1 creep (not the range, as they provide you mana) and when enemy is within the range. Cast the spell to the farthest creep so that the last one to be hit will be the hero, by that way, you can deal  big dmg!",
				"medusa_mana_shield":"Activate mana shield when you sense enemies nearby (effective during early game) and if mid/late game, activate all the time to avoid being ganked!


tips: Don't activate at early game when you want to harras your enemy to avoid mana loss.",
				"medusa_stone_gaze":"Use this when being gank to avoid deaths! and also helpful when you want to kill an enemy with a magic snake and normal hit.



tips: cast this if the enemy can be killed using magic snake."
