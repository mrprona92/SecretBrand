		{
				"sphere":"We get Linken's Sphere over BKB because of the stats Medusa needs and Linken's effect. This is a core item for her because of how well it let's her farm her damage-dealing items.",
				"rapier":"As seen on Showcase Showndown -back to you Bob Barker!",
				"butterfly":"Mana Shield and Evasion work quite nicely for Medusa giving her more survivability without deviating from the stats she likes the most.

Make sure to take advantage of the Flutter active to keep foes far away from you and consistently kiting them around.",
				"manta":"Activating Manta Style will turn off your Mana Shield, be sure to turn it back on! Use this to split-push, disjoint incoming stuns and disables as well as trick opponents into wasting their abilities on your illusions.",
				"satanic":"Lifesteal works with Eye of Skadi but strength is not a stat that helps Medusa's damage output. If you find yourself still melting and unable to stay alive to deal your damage: Satanic is a key item.",
				"skadi":"Similar to Linken's Sphere and how quickly Medusa can now farm: Skadi diminishes the effectiveness of enemy physically carries while also giving her a huge boost in stats.",
				"yasha":"Yasha is a great value item. It gives the speed, attack and is a great step towards Manta Style.",
				"ancient_janggo":"For early-game fights in case the pace of the game is not going the way you want. Skip this if you are getting incredibly good farm and at a relatively good rate."

		{
				"medusa_split_shot":"Split Shot works later in the game where it is most needed to flash-farm lanes, counter-push and tear down foes incredibly fast. Orb effects do not work with Split Shot (only one of the arrows deals the extra orb effects).",
				"medusa_mystic_snake":"Try and make the last jump be on a hero to improve harassment. Don't spam this ability all in one go, try and space them when needed for life and mana.

When using your ultimate, this ability grants pure damage from every hero it hits, so be sure to utilize it!",
				"medusa_mana_shield":"Make sure you keep enough mana for at least your ultimate. Mana Shield works great towards the late-game when you have an access amount of mana and want to take the damage foes engage you with.",
				"medusa_stone_gaze":"Stone Gaze works even if your back is turned. So long as they are looking in your direction, they will still be slowed and crippled.

This works on Black King Bar users; so fire away when they over-commit to fights."
