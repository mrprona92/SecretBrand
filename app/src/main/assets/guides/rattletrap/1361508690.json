		{
				"rattletrap_battery_assault":"Clockwerk signature skill, maxing it first is number-one priority. Keep in mind that the damage instance will be distributed randomly between units in an area so positioning or isolating enemies with Power Cog is very important.",
				"rattletrap_power_cogs":"Best isolate skill in the game, though leveling it to maximum doesn't provide that much of benefit for Clockwerk, so take one level of this early and leave it at that until later.",
				"rattletrap_rocket_flare":"One level at the begining for scouting rune and lane, maxing at 10 for damage and cooldown. Spam it!",
				"rattletrap_hookshot":"Aim about 100 units ahead of the target. Hookshot is quite fast and easy to latch, what important is the combo come after. "
