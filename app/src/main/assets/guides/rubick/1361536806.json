		{
				"blink":"A Blink Dagger makes you more mobile. Buy it if you manage to steal a big area-of-effect nuke.",
				"ghost":"Buy this item if the enemy carry keeps targeting you.",
				"ward_observer":"Pick Wards whenever possible.",
				"courier":"Buy a Courier if nobody bought it.

Other options: Observer Ward.",
				"travel_boots":"If you are your team's main pusher, buy these Boots.",
				"phase_boots":"Buy Phase Boots instead of Arcane Boots if you need more mobility and you already have other ways to replenish your mana pool.",
				"bracer":"Makes you more durable, and gives good stats.

Other options: Urn of Shadows, Medallion of Courage.",
				"mekansm":"Buy a Mekansm if nobody is going to buy it. Its heal is great in every situation.",
				"ring_of_basilius":"Ring of Basilius solves your early mana problems. If you can't manage your mana pool, this item can be really worth the price.",
				"pipe":"The magic resistance from the Pipe stacks with your aura. Use it against a team with many nukers.",
				"urn_of_shadows":"Urn of Shadows can be bought instead of a Bracer if you want to gank often, and nobody has got one in your team.",
				"sheepstick":"Great stats, great mana regeneration, great disable. It costs a lot, but it's worth the price!",
				"cyclone":"This item solves all of your mana problems. Its active ability can be used to save allies or to temporarily remove an enemy from the battlefield.",
				"force_staff":"A Force Staff makes you more mobile and can be used to save teammates.",
				"shivas_guard":"Perfect against carries, or to initiate a battle. The aura and the armor, along with its active ability, make you almost unkillable by auto-attackers.",
				"arcane_boots":"Buy Arcane Boots if your team needs more mana, or if you want to spam your spells.

Other options: Phase Boots.",
				"ancient_janggo":"If you think you need more health and mana, upgrade your bracer into a Drum of Endurance.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"Pick a Medallion of Courage instead of a Bracer if your lane partner can deal a lot of physical damage in the early game.",
				"rod_of_atos":"Rod of Atos is perfect if you need more health and an ability to make ganks easier."
