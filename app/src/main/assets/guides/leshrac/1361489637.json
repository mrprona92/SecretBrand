				"courier":"Either courier or wards, both if you're feeling generous!",
				"tpscroll":"As a support you should always be carrying a TP scroll so that you can rush to someone's aid. There is no excuse not to carry one (except if it's very late and you have farmed some Boots of Travel). ",
				"phase_boots":"Phase boots are great for keeping up with people so that your Nova/Edict do more damage, note that Mana boots are also an option though.",
				"sheepstick":"If you get one of these, you should have won the game by now.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"The additional damage is really great and synergises well with a charged bloodstone.",
				"rod_of_atos":"\"Underrated item\". But seriously, great on Leshrac as he needs the HP, Mana and a slow to keep someone in his Edict/Nova or just to land that easy stun."
