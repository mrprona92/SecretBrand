		{
				"blink":"This lets you initiate, chase, and flee (Eul's then Blink).",
				"magic_wand":"Only get this if you're laning against folks that spam a lot.",
				"travel_boots":"Late-game, Lina pushes and counter-pushes incredibly well. Boots of Travel let her move around the map with impunity.",
				"null_talisman":"Useful, helps with harass and survival early.",
				"mekansm":"Get it if no one else is.",
				"pipe":"Get if your team needs it (lots of enemy magic damage) and no one else has gotten it.",
				"sheepstick":"The best late game item. The enemy team will likely have some nasty carry that wants to right-click you down. With this item they'll be a sheep.",
				"cyclone":"Mana regen, move speed, what's not to love? Oh, and you can use Eul's both offensively (to set up your stun) and defensively (to set up a blink out for yourself, or to save an ally, or to stall for time).",
				"force_staff":"An alternative to Blink. Stats in exchange for a little less mobility. You can also get both, but it isn't  necessary on her.",
				"dagon":"In case people are somehow still not dead, this is an option. But if you've got this to level 5, you've likely already won the game.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"There are better options, but when you really want to boost her Laguna damage this is one way to go.",
				"refresher":"When one Laguna Blade isn't enough...",
				"greater_crit":"Very late game option, when her right-click damage starts outshining her spells.",
				"basher":"Rare circumstances may call for this item. It's only a 10% chance on Lina, but with her attack speed as fast as it is... well, you could say it's a stunning possibility.",
				"mjollnir":"For anti-push and pushing, generally you'll only see this very late game.",
				"ethereal_blade":"Think of it as a double-barreled shotgun, as Tobi put it. First the Ethereal Blade damage, then Laguna Blade (enhanced by the Ethereal Blade effect), then the rest of your spells.",
				"arcane_boots":"Lina likes her mana. And it helps your entire team too.

Generally get boots first, then get the rest of the core, then come back and get Arcane Boots.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Solid all around item, gives you some much needed health. Get it if no one else is."
