		{
				"branches":"Early Stats, builds into a Magic Wand",
				"sobi_mask":"Dazzle has high intelligence so Sage's Mask provides great early game mana regeneration. Builds into Medallion of Courage.",
				"magic_wand":"Particularly effective on Dazzle for burst regen after Shallow Grave. Allows clutch heals and Shallow Graves in situations where you are out of mana.",
				"ghost":"Provides immunity from carries. Very powerful if you are being focussed by a Lifestealer or Anti-Mage.",
				"ward_observer":"Wards win games. If you are the only support, you should be buying them... particulary after your core.",
				"courier":"Your team requires a courier. Buy it if you do not have one.",
				"phase_boots":"The best boots on Dazzle. More damage to exploit is strong attack animation and the speed boost for greater positioning and escapes during team fights. Also helps for chasing.",
				"void_stone":"Dazzle's high natural Intelligence and Intelligence gain mean that Void Stone provides a ton of regen. Great in the mid-game when you are casting all your abilities frequently.",
				"mekansm":"Your team needs one and Dazzle is a great Mek carrier. Turn teamfights with Shallow Grave and Mekansm while providing strong pushing support in the early-mid game.",
				"pipe":"Carrying Mekansm and Pipe of Insight on the same Hero is risky. Your team should have a Pipe though, so decide whether to build this based on your allies.",
				"sheepstick":"Best item in the game. If you can afford a Mystic Staff, you should always aim for this.",
				"orchid":"Great mana regen and a powerful active. The Intelligence and attack speed help if you are going for a more semi-carry Dazzle build. Provides no survivability though, so be careful.",
				"cyclone":"Cheapest mana regen booster with an extremely powerful active to help you survive in team fights. The movement speed boost is also very helpful in unison with Phase Boots.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Makes Weave unmissable and provides and extra 10 Armor to the end of your Weave. Enemy Negative Armor is capped at -20, so this helps against tanky teams.",
				"soul_booster":"If you have no idea what to buy, a Soul Booster is a good pickup. Provides survivability and much needed mana. This item has a free +100% mana regen when you complete it.",
				"arcane_boots":"Not great on Dazzle because his natural mana regen is already high. Get these if you're pure support and haven't got your Phase Boots & Medallion by 20 minutes.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"Extremely powerful item on Dazzle. Provides instant physical damage amplification on your target, and all of your abilities are physical... great with Phase Boots.",
				"heavens_halberd":"Provides a lot of survivability and comes with a powerful anti-carry active."

				"dazzle_poison_touch":"Powerful slow that stuns at Level 3. Delay Level 4 until after your other skills.

INTERRUPTS CHANNELING ABILITIES!",
				"dazzle_shallow_grave":"Difficult to cast effectively until Level 2-3 due to its short range. Try to cast at the last possible moment, but do not risk the death of your carry.

Very powerful with lifestealing Heroes like Ursa, Huskar and Lifestealer.",
				"dazzle_shadow_wave":"Pushes lanes, saves allies, kills enemies and provides gold. Incredibly powerful against melee lane opponents and with illusion-creating allies.

Early game pushing strats should make use of this ability, it can gib creep waves from Level 3.",
				"dazzle_weave":"Very powerful when it has time to set in. Casting it before a teamfight can give your team a huge defensive advantage. Casting it during a battle will typically win you the engagement if people are fighting after 10 seconds.

Consider skipping until Level 10. "
