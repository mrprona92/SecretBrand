		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"blink":"Blink Dagger will allow you to initiate a battle, pursue an escaping hero or just surprise a lone enemy hero by blinking next to him and performing a Toss + Avalanche Como.",
				"boots":"Getting this early in the game will allow you to get close enough for a Toss + Avalanche Combo that can instantly kill a lone enemy.",
				"magic_wand":"Even though it gets useless in late games, it can save your life early on when faced with nuker heroes.",
				"bracer":"The bonus stats allow you to survive longer and have enough mana for you very costly spells.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Due to his large amount of damage received by his Ultimate, Aghanim Scepter allows you to grow a tree in one hand and splash that damage to all nearby enemies. Combined with the Hyperstone or Assault Cuirass later on allows you to quickly deal a huge amount of damage to all enemy heroes.",
				"assault":"After putting points in your ultimate, you gain a large amount of damage but your attack speed decreases significantly. That why it is recommended to put just 1 point in your ultimate after maxing out Toss and Avalanche and putting the rest after buying the Hyperstone or Assault Cuirass.",
				"heart":"Most builds for Tiny are based on initiation and damage deal. Heart of Tarasque will allow you to have a huge HP regeneration and increase your survivability in combat.",
				"black_king_bar":"If the enemy team has a lot of nukers or stunners, after initiating a team fight Tiny will most likely die. The Black King Bar allows you to evade most enemy spells and help your team loger in a fight.",
				"arcane_boots":"Due to the high mana cost of his skills, Arcane Boots is a must for tiny."
