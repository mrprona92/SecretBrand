		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"blink":"Positioning is essential on Tiny, both to land your skills and to attack the most important target, but Dagger gives you no stats whatsoever and doesn`t really help you escape. Not a really good item on Tiny, despite it`s popularity.",
				"gauntlets":"A component of Drums and another source of health will also benefit your laning.",
				"branches":"Giving some very needed health/mana, and beign part of Magic Wand, it`s a very important item in the beggining.",
				"magic_wand":"Almost mandatory in any hero in the game. This tiny, cheap and silent item will save your life as no other. This item also uses the Branches you got earlier and makes them into just 1 slot, which is nice.",
				"flask":"Due to Tiny`s extremely low armor, you are going to need a lot of regeneration in the laning phase. Tangoes  and Salves will help.",
				"bottle":"Might be necessary in lane and mandatory when doing  middle lane. Will help you offset harass and keep doing your own.",
				"tango":"Due to Tiny`s extremely low armor, you are going to need a lot of regeneration in the laning phase. Tangoes  and Salves will help.",
				"tpscroll":"Always carry a TP.",
				"phase_boots":"Phase boots can be changed for Treads if Tiny is required to be a really hard carry, but Phase gives so much more mobility, especially when you combine it with Drums and Tiny`s Ultimate. Also gives damage, which is also nice. This works best on a Tiny that wants to be useful earlier.",
				"power_treads":"A more well-rounded type of boots when compared to Phase. Gives less damage, less movement speed and has no active, but has stats, increasing health/mana and gives attack speed. This is a better choice if Tiny is required to farm longer, since it helps farming more than Phase.",
				"hand_of_midas":"If you get it early, it will give you a very high experience advantage, while still not delaying your core items for that long. ",
				"vladmir":"Usually you will leave it for another hero to make, but if  really needed, gives you a little armor, an ok ammount of damage and a useful lifesteal aura.",
				"force_staff":"Similar to Dagger, but a little bit better. Helps you escape and gives you a little bit of regeneration. But it`s cost if very high for the secondary effects, and Force is not really necessary. This would delay better items and be counter-produtive.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Your farming and pushing most useful tool. If your plan is to take the game late, making this item earlier will give you so much more farm and making Tiny one of the fastest farmers in the game. If the plan is to make the game end early, this item is also very useful for pushing.",
				"assault":"Another item that helps clearing waves and taking towers. Assault, like Drums, give a very nice aura to allies. Another good part of Assault is the VERY needed armor that it gives, as Tiny has close to no armor.",
				"heart":"Natural item for carriers in the late-game. Will help you stay alive longer in fights and recover much faster.",
				"black_king_bar":"Not that common, since it offers little to Tiny apart from the magic immunity, that is usually not that important. But, if you are beign focused and not beign able to deal damage, you have no use, and therefore a BKB is a must.",
				"shivas_guard":"Nice item if you are doing a secondary carry job, or if your team has a high number of core heroes. Gives armor, mana and a very useful slow, that may help you close the gap to the enemy.",
				"butterfly":"Does not give you as much as other items for the price, but what it gives might be what you need. The evasion is the main part of this item in this case, 35% chance of missing is huge, and you also get a nice boost in attack speed.",
				"basher":"You have a passive that works in a very similar fashion and you are not really a fast attacking hero, which means basher will be most often than not, useless. The only time this should be built is if Abyssal Blade is your item choice.",
				"manta":"An upgrade from Yasha, that gives even more of the needed movement speed. Manta gives very nice stats, that are very useful and gives you a way to escape some debuffs.",
				"invis_sword":"Might be done for a funny surprise-combo, but other than that it is pretty much an attack speed item that gives you a poor escape mechanism",
				"satanic":"Extension from Helm of the Dominator, which is the best orb hands down to Tiny. Also gives you a nice increase in your health pool.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Drums will work wonderfully to any carry that wants to get really strong mid-game, which is a very real possibility for a Tiny. Together with Phase boots, it makes running away from a Tiny very hard. Drums gives a pretty useful aura to allies too."

		"AbilityTooltips":
		{
				"tiny_avalanche":"Hard to tell when you should get Avalanche or Toss at level 1, since it will depend a lot on the lane. This is usually taken first since its a better disable. Level 4 of this skill has a very bad scalling, so it should be taken only after maxing Toss.",
				"tiny_toss":"A possibility for your first skill, especially since the buff to constant 1300 range. This should be second priority to Avalanche until level 3, when Toss is much better than level 4 Avalanche.",
				"tiny_craggy_exterior":"Extremelly good passive, giving armor, that is something Tiny really lacks, and a stun chance, that is  a VERY strong `anti-carry` tool later on. Note that it is not limited to melee heroes, they just have to be close to you.",
				"tiny_grow":"Some might take it later than 6 for a higher level of your nukes, but Grow! actually gives you a higher DPS than other skills, apart from the nice movement speed increase and huge damage increase.",
				"attribute_bonus":"You should almost never take this over any other skill, since all others are extremelly good. Should be taken later."
