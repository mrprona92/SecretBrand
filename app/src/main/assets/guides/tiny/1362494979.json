		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"blink":"Core if going for the assassination Tiny build. You blink right next to a hero, Avalanche and Toss them and they die right away. You will be able to hit them a couple of times too while they are disabled. Most supports and squishies drop right away.",
				"stout_shield":"Stout Shield is especially important if you are going mid. Makes you harder to harass out of lane.",
				"bottle":"Only get a Bottle if you are going mid. There is no point in getting a Bottle if you are playing the team carry on your safe lane.",
				"phase_boots":"As you won`t be getting a Blink Dagger (you are focusing on the mid/late game) you need an alternative way of closing the gap. Phase Boots are the way to go. You can also consider Power Treads for the stats and attack speed if you already have heroes that can initiate and hold enemies in place.",
				"hand_of_midas":"You want to take the game into the late game? Get a Midas. Not only it improves your attack speed but it gives you the ability to get gold and xp a lot faster than usual. Only get a Midas if you can get it in 5-6 minutes. Any later than that is just pointless as you delay your core items by a lot.",
				"sheepstick":"Solves your mana problems and allows you to disable even more people at the same time. Not advisable if playing carry Tiny.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"No matter your role, an Aghanim`s is a great pick up on Tiny. Makes you Grow one more time which further boosts your Toss but most importantly gives you cleave, increased range and increased damage to buildings.",
				"assault":"You are definitely lacking attack speed. The -armor aura makes you an extremely fast pusher as buildings drop left and right when you are around.",
				"heart":"Need to stay alive? Here you go!",
				"black_king_bar":"If you are finding yourself stunned to death, consider getting a BKB. Although not the best item for Tiny, the magic immunity allows you to smash faces with little worry about being disabled.",
				"shivas_guard":"Makes you even tankier and solves your mana problems. More suited for a mid caster Tiny.",
				"manta":"Only get this if you are playing the carry role. I know you are not an Agility hero, please hear me out. You get increased movement and attack speeds and some extra stats but most importantly you get 2 additional Tinies who rip buildings and enemies apart. The confusion also helps you stay alive.",
				"mjollnir":"Another item which boosts your attack speed. It also helps you farm if you are playing a carry Tiny as you can get the Maelstrom before Aghanim`s. It is not advisable to get both AC and Mjollnir but you can use the Hyperstone for an AC and not upgrade your Maelstrom if you so desire.",
				"arcane_boots":"You need to be able to cast all your spells with little worry about being out of mana.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Great stats for you and a great aura for you and your team. The aura is considered &quot;a mini Yasha&quot; when the item is not activated and helps Tiny and his team loads."

		"AbilityTooltips":
		{
				"tiny_avalanche":"Avalanche is more useful at early levels than Toss as it does more damage and stuns. Tossed units will take double damage from Avalanche if Toss is used right after Avalanche. Do not Toss first and then Avalanche.",
				"tiny_toss":"You should max this first. Its damage goes through the roof when you put a couple of points in your Grow. You can Toss enemies back to your team by standing next to them and targeting an ally. Deals damage to buildings if you Toss a unit right next to them.",
				"tiny_craggy_exterior":"A solid passive against right clicks and melee carries. You can skip it in favor of stats in the rare cases where the enemy team has no melee right clickers and are lacking physical damage or you just die too fast.",
				"tiny_grow":"One of the unique ultimates in the game. Increases your Toss damage, your movement speed and your damage. Get it at 6 rather than 9 as the damage increase of Toss and the couple right clicks you`ll be able to do while they are in the air/stunned result in more overall damage."
