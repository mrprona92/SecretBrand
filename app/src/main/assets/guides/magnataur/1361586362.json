				"black_king_bar":"In case someone is initiating before you can, Black King Bar will change all that; giving you dominance and reassurance from your team that you can land your Reverse Polarity.",
				"greater_crit":"Mask of Madness and Daedlus work great in-synx with Magnus ability: Empower, but it isn't what's essential to Magnus' main role.",
