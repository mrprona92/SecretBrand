		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"quelling_blade":"This will help you with last hitting and later on, jungling. If you're taking a ring first, make sure to buy this later.",
				"ring_of_protection":"Pick this up if you expect a lot of harass in your lane. Later builds into tranquils.",
				"stout_shield":"Get one of these if you're expecting a lot of physical harass.",
				"tpscroll":"Always carry a TP scroll!",
				"travel_boots":"Boots of Travel let you splitpush much more easily.",
				"power_treads":"After 6.79 you should get Treads instead of Tranqs.",
				"hand_of_midas":"Hand of Midas allows you to increase your farm and get more levels, faster.",
				"poor_mans_shield":"SITUATIONAL: You can get this if you got a Stout Shield at the start. It provides additional protection as well as a nice bit of AGI.",
				"vladmir":"Vladmir's Offering allows you to jungle early if the lane isn't going well, as well as providing sustain. Don't get both a Drum and a Vlad's.",
				"assault":"Can be picked up to increase illusion's tankiness.",
				"heart":"A Heart gives your illusions much more tankiness and allow PL to quickly rejoin a fight with his increased HP regeneration.",
				"black_king_bar":"More necessary this time around, as PL is now more often than not with his illusions. He's also a lot squishier, so having a BKB helps.",
				"sphere":"Can be used against heroes with long single-target disables.",
				"rapier":"Illusions don't get flat damage increase. (But you can still buy it to show off!)",
				"monkey_king_bar":"This only gives your illusions True Strike, not bashes or extra damage. Build against evasive heroes like Brewmaster, Phantom Assassin, or anyone who would build a butterfly.",
				"radiance":"Your illusions only get the +45 damage fire tick, and for this much money you're much better off buying something that increases your damage or survivability more.",
				"butterfly":"Your illusions also get the dodge chance, so they become a lot harder to kill.",
				"greater_crit":"While illusions do benefit from the critical hit chance, they don't get the flat damage increase. Build this as your last item.",
				"basher":"Illusions don't get bash.
",
				"bfury":"No cleave for your illusions, I'm afraid.
",
				"manta":"A Manta Style gives you a lot more splitpushing and teamfight capabilities by allowing you to kickstart your illusion production. Note that Manta/Illusion runes don't count towards Juxtapose, so this allows you to have 10 illusions.",
				"sange_and_yasha":"Illusions can't use Sange's maim. Use that Yasha for a Manta instead.
",
				"skadi":"You can replace your Diffusal Blade with this as a final item.",
				"diffusal_blade":"A diffusal is your first main pickup. The mana burn orb effect works on illusions, so you're hitting a lot harder. The active can be used to chase people down or to kill summons such as Warlock's golems.",
				"soul_ring":"SITUATIONAL: A Soul Ring is a great pickup if you want to harass or possibly kill enemies in your lane. Don't pick this up if you're farming uncontested.",
				"ancient_janggo":"SITUATIONAL: Drum isn't as powerful as it used to be, but can still be picked up if you feel you need extra stats.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"SITUATIONAL: Can be picked up after Diffusal Blade if you're looking to fight early.",
				"abyssal_blade":"Allows you to lock down sneaky targets.",
				"ring_of_aquila":"The aura this item gives doesn't help your illusions much. Build a Drum instead.",
				"tranquil_boots":"Tranquil boots will give you a lot of extra sustain, allowing you to farm and jungle more easily"
