		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"gauntlets":"The extra HP these give will be invaluable to keeping you alive.",
				"branches":"Stats will help you through the laning phase. Build the branches into a wand.",
				"gem":"Kotl isn`t really tanky enough to be relied to hold this but your support role and movement speed means a gem isnt a bad pick up if the team needs one.",
				"magic_wand":"For burst regen you can`t beat a wand. It`s good all game long, espcially against opponents that spam.",
				"flask":"For regen on the go. Remember to buy more if you or your carry need them.",
				"ward_observer":"Vision of the map if key for victory so make sure you always have wards on you and keep re-warding.",
				"tango":"For regen on the go. Remember to buy more if you or your carry need them.",
				"courier":"Get the courier to help everyone out and stop those noob drow players moaning.",
				"travel_boots":"By late game, the regen from tranquils isn`t as useful. So pick up the boots of travel for a global presence to push, defend and farm.",
				"bracer":"This is easy to pick up because of your illuminate. Farm it up quickly for good stats and build into drums if needed.",
				"mekansm":"Your first big support item. This will help everyone out for regen and armour as well as a heal. If someone else picked up a mek, go for pipe instead.",
				"flying_courier":"Get this asap for faster deliveries",
				"headdress":"To stay true to the role of support, get this for aoe regen for your carry and yourself.",
				"sheepstick":"This item is great on KOTL. It gives you a great disable as well as good intel and mana regen. If your team needs some extra help in teamfights get this.",
				"orchid":"The attack speed and damge. can make you more of a right clicker but that is just an added bonus. The mana regen means your chakra magic only needs to be used on your allies and not yourself. It`s main purpose is to silence enemy threats and make them take extra damage so they die much quicker.",
				"force_staff":"Gives you some small HP regen. mainly however, it will give you extra mobility. Help you help teammates to escape ganks or manoeuvre an enemy hero into a position that your team can kill them.",
				"shivas_guard":"If you need some more survivability get shivas. It`s armour will keep you alive and the intelligance is good for mana. The artic blast is a decent nuke but use it for slowing enemies. Try and hit as many as you can.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Drums work well on most heroes and if your team needs them, pick them up. The stats will help you out as well.",
				"tranquil_boots":"The extra movement speed and regen will keep you in lane and doing your job. The best boots for kotl."
