		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"blink":"Astral Imprisonment to let your Blink Dagger get off cooldown, then use it to escape! Very underrated item on Outworld Devourer.",
				"branches":"Increase your last-hitting capabilities with iron branches.",
				"bottle":"If you find yourself needing the extra mana during the laning phase of middle lane due to Astral Imprisonment's cost, pick this item up.",
				"mekansm":"Pick this up for the survivability and if no other support is getting it.",
				"buckler":"Buckler activates your Essence aura, another reason to build this into Mekansm or simply keep it alone for the extra survivability.",
				"sheepstick":"Get this if you can reach the items necessarily, otherwise move on to the Extension Items list.",
				"cyclone":"Great movement speed, incredible disable and offers a bit more intelligence for Outworld Devourer. Use this to initiate fights and/or to save yourself from initial ganks as you can delay attacks for a significant amount of time thanks to this scepter and Astral Imprisonment",
				"force_staff":"Due to Outworld Devourer's slow speed, Force Staff is to help you move in and out of battles and as an escape mechanism.",
				"black_king_bar":"You will find yourself constantly targeted down due to your incredible damage from Arcane Orb. Black King Bar is to prevent this.",
				"shivas_guard":"Shiva's Guard adds extra armor against physical carries while offering a slow to allow you to continue destroying nearby foes.",

				"obsidian_destroyer_astral_imprisonment":"We're getting early levels in Astral Imprisonment due to its low mana cost, great disable and it helps you dominate the lane.

Use this move constantly to diminish the enemy's intelligence and mana pool, allowing you to freely farm without fear with a ton of extra damage.",

				"obsidian_destroyer_sanity_eclipse":"Use this on Strength and Agility heroes with a small mana pool. Be sure to use Astral Imprisonment to take more intelligence from the foe, thus more potential mana to be done."
