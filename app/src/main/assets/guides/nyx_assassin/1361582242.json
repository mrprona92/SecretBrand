		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"bottle":"Get this if in the middle-lane and desperate for mana/life regeneration.",
				"urn_of_shadows":"Use Urn of Shadows offensively or defensively to constantly earn kills and stay alive, roaming.

If you can't reach Dagon in time, just get Urn of Shadows and move on.",
				"sheepstick":"Scythe of Vyse just further adds to Nyx Assassin's capabilities to gank and contribute to fights when the late-game comes around.",
				"dagon":"Dagon nets you fast kills and with your ability combination, you can nearly kill off any hero in the game.

Do not take more than 20 minutes to get this item, if you can't get it, don't keep pushing for it as it becomes less and less effective.",
				"necronomicon":"Get this at level 3 for the true sight. This helps your pushing line-up, reveal invisible foes and further attack speed and damage.",
				"ethereal_blade":"Ethereal Blade synergizes well with Nyx Assassin's moves after his ultimate, furthering the damage."

		{
				"nyx_assassin_impale":"Impale is not a guaranteed stun when clicking on a hero and works by targeting by point and not by target, making stuns being more manually chosen and less guaranteed.",
				"nyx_assassin_mana_burn":"Mana Burn's mana cost is constant, the damage multiplier goes up with each level, so leveling it fast is up to you.",
				"nyx_assassin_spiked_carapace":"Spiked Carapace has a constant mana cost and constant reflect duration (how long it stays active on you), use it when you know you'll be targeted or to counteract stuns. This ability is a great escape mechanism and should be maxed second.",
				"nyx_assassin_vendetta":"Open with Vendetta to hit foes then follow up with Impale, Mana Burn to finish off your opponent (with Urn of Shadows or Dagon)."
