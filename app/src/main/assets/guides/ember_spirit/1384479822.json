		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"stout_shield":"For extra sustain in the mid lane, considering you're melee + builds into vanguard/poor mans shield",
				"bottle":"Definitely a bottle-rush hero. His abilities are on a low cooldown, and his int gain isn't great. Refilling your bottle in the fountain using a tp+your ult is great as well!",
				"tango":"If you feel you need more regen, get an extra salve as well. But since this is a fast bottle build, one tango should do.",
				"phase_boots":"Exploiting the already great movement speed this hero already has. If you feel you are lacking in mana however, and you can't rune control, get arcane boots.",
				"vladmir":"Can be great if your team doesn't have a natural vlads carrier. You get lifesteal from your autoattacks + Sleight Of Fists. The extra damage doesn't hurt.",
				"assault":"Extra - armor, always great for physical dps. Not the best item pickup but doable.",
				"black_king_bar":"Our friend Xin is useless when silenced/stunned, and will die rapidly. Get this item to not have those things happen to you. (if you're worried)",
				"sphere":"Same as black king bar. The early perseverance gets rid of some of your mana problems and gives you some health regen.",
				"rapier":"This speaks for itself. Go for it if you feel you have the power!!",
				"radiance":"If you get ridiculously fed, this stacks with your Flame Guard. Pretty funny!",
				"greater_crit":"Your sleight of fists can crit!",
				"basher":"Chance to bash on every hit is great. Works on sleight of fists.",
				"bfury":"If you're really overfarmed, and you're versus illusion/summon based heroes (like PL, meepo,...) get 2 of these. Decent mana and health regen will keep you in the fights longer and make your sleight of fist hurt pretty hard.",
				"sange_and_yasha":"I like getting the Sange for the maim chance and extra hp.",
				"satanic":"Using the active on this with Sleight of Fists brings you up to full health in no time! Expensive, but a decent pickup nonetheless.",
				"mjollnir":"Not great, but the active is pretty powerful. The attack speed is mostly redundant on this hero though.",
				"skadi":"Slow, a lot of HP, ...",
				"maelstrom":"Honestly, don't bother upgrading to mjollnir. This hero doesn't need the attack speed. Every Sleight Of Fists hit counts as an attack, so if this procs your damage goes way up.",
				"desolator":"-Armor when using sleight of fists... It's great if your team has other physical dps, and gives you a bit extra damage.",
				"yasha":"Extra damage, and again, the +% movespeed is great.",
				"arcane_boots":"A great alternative to phase boots, getting arcane boots on this hero gets rid of some of the mana issues this hero has.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Same as phase boots, going fast is good. The +% movespeed scales great on a hero with this fast base movespeed. Extra mana to use, a bit more hp... ",
				"abyssal_blade":"If the game is tied but you're still far ahead this is a very solid choice. You can use the activate while using sleight of fists, and gives a very solid damage boost. "

		"AbilityTooltips":
		{
				"ember_spirit_searing_chains":"Max this first for the disable. With this and flame guard + some right click you should be able to run people down.",
				"ember_spirit_sleight_of_fist":"With the slight \"nerf\" this has received, it only becomes useful once you get items. Hence why maxing this last is ideal.",
				"ember_spirit_flame_guard":"Max this to run people down. It's basically a buffed radiance. Since 6.81 this also stops doom damage, so try to predict when doom is getting used!",
				"ember_spirit_activate_fire_remnant":"Costs a lot of mana, but does decent damage, is good for juking and other neat tricks. ",
				"ember_spirit_fire_remnant":"You can gank really effectively by placing one of these in mid, tp'ing to another tower, ganking, and then jumping back to your remnant. Also this is a decent nuke. Be sure to save one for escaping though."
