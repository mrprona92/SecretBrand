		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"blink":"Gives great mobility that can be used to catch opponents who are out of range or to escape. Makes Shadow Demon very slippery when combined with Force Staff.",
				"boots":"Early move speed to secure runes.",
				"magic_wand":"A Magic Wand can help against opponents who frequently use abilities against you. The Wand can be argued to be optional in some match-ups.",
				"ghost":"A good defensive item if Shadow Demon is being focused by carries during team fights. Be careful of magic damage while you are in Ghost Form.",
				"bottle":"The starting items allow you to have a Bottle delivered to you right before the two minute mark if you are able to get most of your last hits.",
				"phase_boots":"Active allows you to check runes or gank lanes faster. Damage it provides helps you with last hits and denies.",
				"mekansm":"If no one else on your team has one this is a great pick up. Active gives area of effect healing and armor buff which can decide a team fight.",
				"pipe":"Active can save you and team mates from magic damage. The item itself give you substantial health regeneration and magic resistance.",
				"sheepstick":"Active can disable a dangerous carry on their team. Item itself gives every stat that Shadow Demon could want.",
				"force_staff":"Great tool for escaping or attacking. (Getting out of a dangerous opponent's range, pushing yourself to catch an enemy, etc.)",
				"necronomicon":"Active adds pushing power while the item itself gives good stats to Shadow Demon. Note that LVL 3 Necronomicon gives an ally that can detect stealth and the ranged ally has a mana burn ability.",
				"invis_sword":"The active can be used offensively or defensively. For example: engage on someone who is farming alone or push a tower hard and walk away when someone shows up. In both cases be careful of stealth detection.",
				"arcane_boots":"Early game the active helps sustain your mana in lane. Later your allies benefit from the active as well.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Good stats for you while giving a passive and active that benefits your team. Note that buying the recipe again will refresh the drum's charges if needed."
