		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"ring_of_protection":"A great starting item - Visage's attack range is amazing, so you'll want to harass.

This keeps you from feeling the damage you'll take in return.",
				"magic_stick":"Can solve your early-game mana pool problems. Only cost efficient if you're laning against two spell casters.",
				"ward_observer":"Now that you can hand off wards, you have no reason NOT to buy them.",
				"tpscroll":"Teleport to gank or to counter-gank the enemy team.",
				"power_treads":"You can no longer disassemble Tranquil boots, so we skip them completely. Keep brown boots until you can buy Treads.",
				"mekansm":"You get your Mek a minute or two late. But your Treads give you a much stronger mid-game.",
				"flying_courier":"Buy it with your first round of gank gold or leave it for your other support.",
				"buckler":"Build this before Medllion if you're getting harassed.",
				"ring_of_basilius":"I usually skip Ring of Basi. However, I sometimes finish it mid game with my spare Ring of Protection. ",
				"assault":"More damage, more survivability and a debuff for the enemy team. This item synchs perfectly with your late game role - edge of teamfight right click / nuker.",
				"maelstrom":"Buy this before your AC. You get 25 more attack speed. And a 120 dmg AoE nuke (which adds an average of 30 bonus dmg to every auto attack.)

Maelstorm + Treads = Dangerous Mid-Game Visage.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"Build this before Buckler if you get an early gank.",
				"tranquil_boots":"The poor man's support boots: Easy to afford, they allow you to stay in lane for farm, harass or ganking. Don't worry about the mana cost - your mana pool regens fast and you only burst nuke every few minutes."

		{
				"visage_grave_chill":"A great ganking slow. The duration increase isn't amazing - but you notice the difference between 3 and 4 seconds. So we sneak a second level in as soon as we can.",
				"visage_soul_assumption":"Use this nuke to secure kills or to burst down supports in team fights. An easy way to manage your soul charges: Start nuking once ANYONE hits half HP. (Whether on your team or the other team.)

Then continue to spam this nuke on cooldown.",
				"visage_gravekeepers_cloak":"This extra armor helps you survive and mini-tank while you nuke. The increase from level 2 to level 3 is HUGE! So we get 3 as fast as possible. But we put off maxing it until our slow  is a little bit stronger.",
				"visage_summon_familiars":"Micro your familiars with care - each is worth 100 gold. Remember: Familiars have an AOE stun. Used correctly, you can stun lock an enemy team for a full 4 seconds."
