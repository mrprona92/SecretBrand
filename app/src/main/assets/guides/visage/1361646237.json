I do not get it all the time but it is a really good item on visage, highly recommand but skippable item.",

Get Point booster first.

				"visage_gravekeepers_cloak":"Great spell that makes you tanky. you should get this instead of grave chill at 8-9-10 if you against somebody who got good spell power ( like rocket Tinker), cause this spell gives you good magic resistance.",
				"visage_summon_familiars":"DO NOT FEED THESE, they give 100 gold each.
If used correctly they will kill any hero really easy.
They have extremely high magic resistance (96.25%) but very low physical resistance, so be carefull against physical spells or pure damage spells.
Also helps to have rune control "
