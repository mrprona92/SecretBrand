				"sobi_mask":"Get the recipe for Soul Ring as the rest of the items can be bought at the side shop.",
				"mekansm":"Since you can farm fairly fast and Dark Seer doesn't need any items, you are ideal to pick up Mekansm, especially when you will be in the fight initiating.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Improves your ultimate ability and initiation with Aghanim's Scepter as foes are coupled into the Wall of Replica receiving an immense amount of damage.",
				"shivas_guard":"Shiva's Guard offers you additional physical protection from attacks while also giving you a major slow that works well with your vacuum.",
				"soul_ring":"Soul Ring let's you spam your Ion Shell without being directly put in danger and amass the gold you need to snag Mekansm.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Drums of Endurance if you need more survivability and find yourself getting picked off a lot of times. Offers great buffs for your allies as well."

				"dark_seer_surge":"You only want two levels in Surge for the escape. We are setting up Vacuum with your ultimate at level 10-11.",
				"dark_seer_wall_of_replica":"This is your ultimate and it is pretty powerful too. Open this up in the middle of the team-fight and then follow-up with Vacuum. This one of the best current initiations in the game."
