				"bottle":"Bottle is great if you intend to roam as Disruptor and take advantage of the runes!",
				"ward_observer":"Be sure to purchase courier or wards as a support hero.",
				"courier":"Be sure to purchase courier or wards as a support hero.",
				"mekansm":"Get Mekansm if no one else is going to get it.",
				"urn_of_shadows":"Survivability. Period. Urn is a situational item because you don't want to delay other items that you'll need in the extention, but you also made need something to ferry through the mid to late-game. ",
				"cyclone":"Eul's Scepter gives you the desperate movement speed that you need and let's you easily set up your Kinetic Field!",
				"force_staff":"Disruptor is about positioning and staying away from being in the center of fights. Force Staff let's you initiate and escape with ease and comfortability.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Aghanim's on Disruptor sounds good, but so late in the game with so many other items needed; may mean that you might have to skip this for more reliable disables and situational items.",
				"rod_of_atos":"Slow enemies hard enough to get trapped in your Kinetic Field. Given its range, this gives Disruptor a ton of time to catch up or let allies chase after the slowed target."

				"disruptor_thunder_strike":"Although the damage is amazing, Kinetic Field and Glimpse are much more versatile in their uses and early ganks. Be sure to count the number of strikes occur on a hero. The third one means Glimpse would return him to where you last casted Thunder Strike.",
				"disruptor_glimpse":"Maxing Glimpse first means an incredible range from heroes who are trying to flee. Be sure to use Glimpse on heroes that are also teleporting to a tower, it'll force them back to the fountain!",
				"disruptor_kinetic_field":"If your opponent gets out of the Kinetic Field before it is done, try and Glimpse them back. Be sure to follow-up your ultimate inside the Kinetic Field.",
				"disruptor_static_storm":"Static Storm is an AOE Silence that deals decent damage. Use it in combination with Kinetic Field. Try avoid using it on heroes that are fleeing."
