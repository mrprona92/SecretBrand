				"bottle":"Even when laning, Tusk needs bottle to keep his mana up and running",
				"assault":"Tusk has some pretty decent damage thanks to Desolator. Assault Cuirass is to bolster his presence with your main carry as well as play down enemies' armor even more!",
				"heart":"Tusk can get into fights, but can't stay in. Heart of Tarrasque gives him the bold strength Tusk looks like he has.",
				"greater_crit":"Make that One-Hit Punch even more defining of its intention.",
				"bfury":"Go for this if you can snag it before the 18-minute mark.",
				"invis_sword":"Try and activate Walrus PUNCH before activating Shadow Blade, the damage stacks with one another to dish out an even strong punch.",
				"desolator":"Strong damage, incredible armor reduction makes this a great item for Tusk and his ultimate. The alternatives being Battlefury are also good as well!",
				"orb_of_venom":"The Orb of Venom continues the slow and damage after the initial hit. It's relatively cheap and works quite well for Tusk.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Snowball works in combination with your movement speed. The faster the movment speed, the faster the snowball. Activate Drum of Endurance before using Snowball.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"Medallion + Your Ultimate allows for extra damage at a minimal cost!"

				"tusk_ice_shards":"Open with Ice Shards to entrap foes so you can later Snowball onto them. The range is incredible, so use it often to really scare off your opponents.

It does not stop where your foe is, but keeps going to where you selected. So plan well and in view of your opponent will be, not where they are.",
				"tusk_snowball":"Snowball can be used both as a guardian angel, in which you can save allies from taking immediate nuke damage or stuns as well as to initiate onto foes.

Anyone inside the snowball is invulnerable to targeting and damage. So get your allies to click inside your snowball as you start building up.",
				"tusk_frozen_sigil":"You won't need the Frozen Sigil until later in the game. Don't let it get destroyed otherwise the enemy team receives a large amount of gold for it. If undirected, the Sigil will follow Tusk. It takes 3 to 4 hits to destroy it.",
				"tusk_walrus_punch":"Use Walrus Punch in combination with Shadow Blade. Walrus Punch is an ability you activate: Turn it on and normally attack your opponent for it to work."
