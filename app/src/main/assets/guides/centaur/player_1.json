When active, make sure to run over enemies to slow them down before attacking them.\nRemember to be situationally aware as you can use this skill to help teammates across the map to escape tight situations. Use it often due to its low CD.","centaur_return":"Max this out early as possible to put more hurt to enemies, while you dish your own damage onto them.\nIn mid-late game with HoT, you can farm creep waves just by watching their own damage wipe them all.\nRemember the equation, more +str items \u003d more Return dmg","centaur_double_edge":"Powerful in early game, use this frequently to harrass low HP pool heroes once you obtain Tranquil Boots.","centaur_hoof_stomp":"Just skill into this once in the beginning. \nRemember you can swap skilling this for Double Edge after lvl1 if you feel bloodthirsty."}},"Hero":"centaur","ItemBuild":{"ItemTooltips":{"heart":"HoT. Hmmm green bar regen. Yummy!","tranquil_boots":"HP regen boost. Once obtained, harass enemy, sit out of line of sight and watch it do magic to your green bar. Rinse and repeat.","basher":"Stun procs makes everyone happy :)\nExcept the receiving end :(","mjollnir":"Mjolnir+Rad\nIf you are getting a lot of hurt and feeling like putting a lot of hurt back, get this.

Follow this up with Vanguard or Hood.","ring_of_protection":"Purchase this in advance so that you can build your Tranquil Boots quickly as other components can be purchased off the secret shop.","hood_of_defiance":"Skip Vanguard and get this instead if enemy team is caster-heavy.","stout_shield":"Gives you room to farm and harass enemy early game.","blade_mail":"If you are getting hit pretty hard in early teamfights (i.e. being focused) or if enemy team is melee-heavy, you can go for this first before getting Blink Dagger.\nRemember to activate it when enemy starts training on you, not when you are just beginning to engage.","abyssal_blade":"Upgrade your Basher for maximum stun. Bonus points if used on troll heroes (they get bashed, get it?? troll bashing. No? ok..)","blink":"Surprise! Bam! and they start scampering..\nRemember, a well placed Blink followed by Stomp will almost assuredly win your side in teamfights.","tango":"Just to help you with HP recovery before you obtain Tranquil Boots.","assault":"AC+Basher\nMore atk spd \u003d more stuns.
