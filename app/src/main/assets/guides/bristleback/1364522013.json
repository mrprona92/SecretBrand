				"stout_shield":"Strong defensive start with items you'll need later.",
				"sobi_mask":"You can choose to turn this into a medallion (for synergy with your snot) or just keep it for a little extra regen.",
				"magic_wand":"Virtually mandatory. You're gonna get spammed on.",
				"pipe":"Natural conclusion to your hood.",
				"urn_of_shadows":"Very situational. If you're running around ganking, maybe. Generally Bristle opens and tanks, rather than ganking. He need time to stack up his snots and quills.",
				"assault":"More anti-armor, but quite a luxury.",
				"heart":"Don't get a heart. You need to take hits continuously to be effective.",
				"blade_mail":"Your job is to get hit. This'll make em pay for it.",
				"radiance":"You'd have to be doing pretty well to get a rad.",
				"arcane_boots":"I would only go mana boots if there are other highly mana-dependant heroes on your team who aren't planning to get said boots themselves.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"Even less armor, even more snot."
