				"night_stalker_void":"Excellent burst damage, good range. Use it to initiate anytime you want to grab a night time hero-snack. Combo it with your silence (W) to make sure you land the kill if they have crowd control. Also, the low CD on it makes for excellent last shots if they get under a tower for shelter.",
				"night_stalker_crippling_fear":"This skill is often needed before the first night to keep crowd control heroes silenced while you bash them to an early grave. Make sure to have at least 1 point before first night.",
				"night_stalker_hunter_in_the_night":"The skill which really defines Balanar and makes him the fear inspiring monster of the night that he is. Attackspeed and movement speed. Nothing escapes in combination with Q and W.",
				"night_stalker_darkness":"As soon as the first night arrives, use this instantly to prolong the night. When night time arrives, use this as soon as cooldown allows you to. Don't use it in daytime unless you really need to, it's better used to prolong the night into eternity and let you roam."
