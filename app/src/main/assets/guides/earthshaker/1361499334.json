		{
				"blink":"Great initiation tool for Echo Slam, as Earthshaker has really low movespeed. Do ask your teammates, if doing well, to give up some space for you to farm this up before any future engages.",
				"magic_wand":"The charges can be a lifesaver during teamfights as it is an instant heal.",
				"ghost":"Get this if the enemy team has a couple of heroes with a really strong physical presence that can burst you down really quickly.

examples are rikimaru, clinkz, naix.",
				"clarity":"Earthshaker has a really low mana pool at the start, so getting a couple of these will be a good idea.",
				"ward_observer":"Wards are really important in giving your team vision to protect from ganks.
",
				"tango":"Always get a set of tangos and salve for early game to deal with harassments. Do pass some to your teammate if he runs out and needs to stay in lane.",
				"tpscroll":"Always have a tp scroll with you just in case another lane gets ganked. This is really important; always keep a spare tp scroll with you. Walk to lanes to keep this off cooldown just in case another lane needs your help.",
				"soul_ring":"Soul ring is quite a good way to keep your mana pool healthy in clutch situations. Earthshaker has a healthy hp pool so the hp decrease will not be very detrimental.",
				"arcane_boots":"Getting this will increase your total mana pool and allows you to be more efficient in defending and in teamfights.",
				"veil_of_discord":"Depending on your team whether it is full of magic casters, getting this may result in higher damage in a teamfight than an aghanim's scepter."
