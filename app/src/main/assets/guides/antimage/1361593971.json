				"ring_of_health":"An early ring of Health to build towards Battle Fury and to avoid harassment in the lane as he farms his initial items.",

				"dagon":"For the true 420 players.",
				"heart":"Survivability is all that Anti-Mage needs now to deal his Mana Break and ultimately tear the enemy team down.",
				"black_king_bar":"After Manta Style, Black King Bar is your last item given it lets you consistently deal mana burn and damage to the enemy without being interrupted. ",
				"manta":"Manta Style works alongside your passive ability: Mana Break, dealing more damage and sapping their mana faster.",
				"abyssal_blade":"Consider Basher and Abyssal Blade to keep rivaling physical carries down and you high on your damage as your agility is sufficient.",
				"tranquil_boots":"If you just can't seem to survive in the lane, pick these up.
Later, disassemble them to make Vladmir's Offering."

Mana Void also does a ministun, so be sure to use it to disrupt channeling spells or teleport scrolls."
