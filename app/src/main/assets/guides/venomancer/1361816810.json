		{
				"ghost":"If you are having problems with right click carries",
				"clarity":"Clarity is required to gank or get lane kills early on. as venmous gale is an expensive level one skill",
				"ward_observer":"Always go for level 1 wards even if u have to buy both wards and courier. Contiune warding troughout the game, buy about 1 stack ever 6 min",
				"courier":"Always go for a courier if nobody else is getting it.",
				"bracer":"Venomancer is very squishy and bracers is a cheap effective way to get hit points. Skip this if you are doing very well",
				"mekansm":"A good item on venomancer if you can get it early enough (before 25 min)",
				"flying_courier":"Use your first 220 gold to upgrade courier if no one have already done so",
				"urn_of_shadows":"Good item if you get some early kills",
				"sheepstick":"Late game hex is always good if you get enough farm",
				"cyclone":"Flat movement speed helps venomancers low base movement speed",

				"ultimate_scepter":"Good damage increase if you get early farm or kills",
				"manta":"Venomancer is not a carry...",
				"invis_sword":"If you find it hard to land an ultimate force staff or blink dagger is better. Venomancer will not benefit from the damage and attack speed",
				"arcane_boots":"If there is enough arcanes on the team tranquil or threads can be used instead.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Get if you already have bracers and nobody on the team have drums",
				"smoke_of_deceit":"Venomancer is an excellent ganker. Smoke is only needed in higher skilled games where people buy wards.",
				"rod_of_atos":"A good choice of you skipped the arcane boots and still need some extra hp. Can be very effective against enemies that can easily be kited",
				"heavens_halberd":"Late game survivability and good against right click carries. Disarm works even if target use bkb after being affected",
				"ring_of_aquila":"Basi ring can be good in some situations, but get a bracer instead of the wraithband "
