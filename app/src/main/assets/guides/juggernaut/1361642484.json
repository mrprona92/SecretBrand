		{
				"quelling_blade":"Pick this up if having trouble last-hitting/farming.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Aghanmin's  on Juggernaut is not too bad. It makes your Omnislash ability incredibly powerful and to last a long time, keeping you out of the way of damage, but also dealing a ton of damage to opponent's around you.",
				"black_king_bar":"Typically good if you are going for Pure Carry to avoid being disabled or hexed.",
				"butterfly":"Butterfly makes you an incredibly auto-attack with insane dodge and stronger critical strikes. Be sure to use Flutter to engage foes who can flee easily or to run away from ganking teams!",
				"bfury":"This item is used for farming. Get it as soon as possible. It works great with your critical effect and damage.",
				"sange_and_yasha":"A good substitute if you can't reach for bigger items.",
				"desolator":"In combination with Battle Fury, you'll be destroying teams incredibly fast.",
				"ancient_janggo":"Drums of Endurance with Phase Boots gives you incredible speed and last-hitting strength to farm your Aghanim's Scepter fast at a minimal cost.",
				"abyssal_blade":"Keep enemies down and disabled with Abyssal Blade (and Basher). Abyssal Blade gives Juggernaut even more damage and tears down rivaling carries who are also competing to carry their team.",
				"tranquil_boots":"If getting harassed heavily, Tranquil boots may be your fix."

		{
				"juggernaut_blade_fury":"Try to avoid abusing this ability to try and snag early kills unless confident with your ally. Blade Fury also serves as a nice escape for you as no one can stun or disrupt you during the sequence. If ganked: Use Blade Fury and follow it up with a TP scroll.",
				"juggernaut_healing_ward":"Don't underestimate Healing Ward. It is an incredible ability that can make your team incredibly safe. If not destroyed, the heal from Healing Ward would heal them for 6% of their max health (Heart of Tarrasque is only 2%)

At the start, use it to keep in the lane.",
				"juggernaut_omni_slash":"Try to avoid using this when near creeps or units. Omnislash does immense damage and can kill most frail heroes if used only on him/her. Omnislash also has a ministun so make use of that to cancel channeling spells.",
				"attribute_bonus":"Stats are obtained to help with his last-hitting/farm and increase his mana pool slightly."
