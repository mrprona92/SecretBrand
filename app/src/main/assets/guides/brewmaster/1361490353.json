		{
				"blink":"A MUST IN BREW but i dont recommend if u dont go bottle or sould ring unless you are rushing aghanim and then you will have a large mana pool",
				"stout_shield":"Good Survivability early",
				"bottle":"A must in mid, i dont usually do when i dont go mid but it is great even though you are not mid because brew is really mana dependent and if mid hero not a rune dependent jjust go for the runes and roam",
				"phase_boots":"In the beggining i always used to do treads it is good early good AS and u cant switch either for some mana or for some tankyness but phase give 24 damage for the early crit and the active of passive is just amazing giving a lot of speed which is wonderful sometimes and helps you survive.",
				"bracer":"Good stats plus will upgrade to drums",
				"vladmir":"Same as Satanic or HoD",
				"ultimate_scepter":"I put in the core but this is only if u go more initiator and if there arent hard carries in your team like pl and pa and void because if you are the main carry dont go for agahnis.",
				"assault":"Great item, but you can indeed go for mjolnir instead but the assault aura is wonderful, mjolnir better for early farm(maelstrom)",
				"heart":"Go if you want tanky panda dont go if there is a NAIX",
				"black_king_bar":"only if u have a lot of disablers because your ult is just amazing because you have bkb earth panda and they count as ancients",
				"shivas_guard":"Gives the extra armor which enables you to tank alongside the active which is really good, just active use ur abilities ult and then they are troubled. Also solves ur mana problems.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"go after cranium if they have guys like pa and windrunner and troll",
				"bfury":"Good Item you can go instead of armlet or after it if you want to be a good carry a farm a lot and then you will farm every single jungle camp easily",
				"armlet":"It is really great item and if ur going carry even better, it gives good stats and active is just amazing and saves sometimes, and the hp regen is great plus soul ring.",
				"satanic":"Panda doesnt really needs lifesteal but it is good indeed. Go for it if you are being ganked a lot and go jungle and go if none in your team has",
				"soul_ring":"just the recipe and you only buy this if you go to either top or bot lane because in mid you dont have side shop to finish soul ring'
If u go mid which i recommend just do stout and tangos and salve and save fast for bottle.",
				"arcane_boots":"Some Midders get this so that they can Spam Clap and Beer and so that they will have eternal mana and never have mana problems, iin my opinion soul ring and bottle are enough to handle mana problems ;)",
				"ancient_janggo":"great stats good aura helps a lot.",
				"abyssal_blade":"Great item to go after armlet(early cranium basher) but with assault or mjoln is even better. Perma bash plus AS is gg"

				"brewmaster_thunder_clap":"Huge Amount of Slow and very good for a surprise first blood. Blink Clap Beer hit and if in teamfight ult. Use soul ring before Clap or Clap soul ring and Ult. Spam soul ring and this too farm if can.",
				"brewmaster_drunken_haze":"Really underrated but so fuckin op ability, gets the guy slowly as fuck cause he's fuckin drunk and drunk guy doesnt hit things. Spam this on their carry and when ganking.",
				"brewmaster_drunken_brawler":"Have you ever wanted to be like CK or Mortred or Jugg and also have evasion? Here it is. Really op passive giving u crit and evasion.",
				"brewmaster_primal_split":"Most amazing ult in the game, but hard to micro for newcomers and guys with not much experience. Its all based on stun with earth, attack with the others, if it's a teamfight or 1v2 situation just cyclone the other guy that's interfering kill one, dispel cyclone kill two and dont forget shadow walk "
