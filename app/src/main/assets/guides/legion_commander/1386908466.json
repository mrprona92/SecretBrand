Enables you to blink towards low hp/fleeing enemies and duel them for perma damage.",
				"assault":"Assault Cuirass is amazing on you.

In some situations you might want to skip Blink and get this or blade mail as fast as possible. 

The aura works while Duelling and it gives lots of Armor and Attack Speed.",
				"heart":"Who doesn't love heart?",
				"black_king_bar":"Really great if the enemy team has a lot of disables as an example.

Only use this before a duel if you are afraid someone might nuke you while you're dueling (example: Lina's ulti).",
				"blade_mail":"Great item, works well vs physical heroes with a lot of damage &amp; reflects damage on nukers and such",
				"greater_crit":"Helps you wipe the enemy team after winning many duels.",
				"armlet":"Use this and Press the Attack before a duel.",
				"mjollnir":"I highly recommend Mjollnir, you might even want it over Desolator. It's situational.",
				"desolator":"Huge advantage in duels and is overall awesome on her. Get this or Mjollnir.",
				"medallion_of_courage":"Medallion Of Courage is a really useful item. If you find yourself with either great quantity of Gold or with terribly low quantity then get it. Gives Mana Regeneration, which you need, and it's Armour reducing skill is a great addition for Duel."
