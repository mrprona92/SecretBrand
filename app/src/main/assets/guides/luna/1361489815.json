		"ItemTooltips":
		{
				"blink":"If the other team has such a strong disdain for your Shadow Blade that they obtain multiple and/or effective ways of countering it, a Blink Dagger may serve well as an alternate escape mechanism.",
				"claymore":"Claymore gives Luna a damage boost, which combined with her already high base damage makes her attacks really leave a bruise. It also brings her one step closer to her core Shadow Blade.",
				"travel_boots":"Boots of Travel are especially helpful if you're on the defensive, as they allow you to make a push up a lane and instantly return to base to defend should the need arise.",
				"wraith_band":"Wraith Bands give Luna a little statboost that can make huge difference in the oftentimes close earlygame fights.",
				"ultimate_scepter":"Luna's ultimate, when used correctly, can be incredibly powerful. If you find yourself using it often, Aghanims may be the way to go.
",
				"black_king_bar":"As already stated, Luna can't take much abuse. Pretty much any two stuns in a row and she's down for the count. A single nuke can deal heavy damage to her. Black King Bar allows her to avoid being stunned or nuked.",
				"butterfly":"Butterfly is a nice luxury if you have plenty of money and nothing of greater significance to purchase, thanks to its evasion and massive agility boost.",
				"manta":"Manta can be incredibly powerful on Luna due to her high DPS.",
				"invis_sword":"This item is an absolute necessity on Luna. Luna may be a heavy hitter, but her HP pool is low and she has no default means of getting away when a fight turns sour. It can also serve as a great initiator as it allows you to get in close range with a foe and then hit them with a triple damage glaive.",
				"satanic":"Satanic is always a decent choice on Luna due to her incredibly high DPS and low HP pool."
