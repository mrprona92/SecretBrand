				"power_treads":"Extra HP and extra attack speed, just what Luna needs. This is now the preferred boots over Tranquil boots following the changes introduced in 6.79.",
				"bracer":"Cost-effective HP/stats boost and can be built into Drums laters.",
				"assault":"If no one else from the team can build AC then it's not a bad choice for Luna.",
				"heart":"If you need extra survivability. ",
				"black_king_bar":"Magic immunity is a must in late game team fight.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"A good counter to enemy carry with high evasion.",
				"butterfly":"A must for most agi carry heroes, it gives Luna more right-click powers and make her moon glavies bouncing like crazy. Also, the passive evasion is imperative in late-game man fights.",
				"manta":"More push power and can be used to dispel some negative effects on Luna like entangle.",
				"satanic":"Natural progression from Helm of Dominator",
				"helm_of_the_dominator":"HoD provides Luna a good sustain on her lane, and you should always dominate a creep (range unit preferred) to help you stack neutral camps.",
				"yasha":"The extra movement speed greatly enhances Luna's chasing power and also helps to land more hits from her ultimate.

Built into Manta in late game.",
				"ancient_janggo":"A nature progression from bracer and the extra int can be useful for just one more beam.",
				"tranquil_boots":"Help stay in the lane and abuse opponent with Luna's high right-click damage. Also help Luna to farm jungles.

It can be disassembled and built to treads.

The recent nerf has made this less attractive but still a decent choice in early games. However, you may want to build it to treads earlier."
