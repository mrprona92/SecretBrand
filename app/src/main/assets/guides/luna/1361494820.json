				"ring_of_protection":"For your future Tranquil Boots.",
				"heart":"In case you need more HP and don`t have a lot of damage in order to go for a Satanic, Heart is the right choice. You can get it straight after Manta/BKB.",
				"black_king_bar":"Required in order to be able to right click people without being interrupted.",
				"monkey_king_bar":"Daedalus adds more overall damage but MKB can help against those pesky evasion heroes (PA, Brewmaster, etc. or Butterfly carries).",
				"butterfly":"Butterfly coupled with BKB makes you really hard to kill. Adds a bit of damage and attack speed too.",
				"greater_crit":"If you need more damage :)",
				"manta":"Manta for survivability and increased DPS. Can be replaced by Drums.",
				"satanic":"If you feel you need more HP and have enough damage to benefit from the lifesteal, then go for it. Usually you want to get a damage dealing item first (to make full use of the lifesteal).",
				"helm_of_the_dominator":"Think of Helm as your Midas in a way - if you are doing well, go for it and stack the ancients. If you are having a hard time, get the BKB first.",
				"tranquil_boots":"Allows you to jungle and stay in lane."

				"luna_lucent_beam":"You need to max Lucent Beam asap as your ult depends on it. It is also a pretty strong nuke too. Get it on level 1 if your lane is going to be contested.",
				"luna_moon_glaive":"It is not recommended getting this early as it pushes the lane which is generally bad. Get it around level 10 in order to jungle quicker.",
				"luna_lunar_blessing":"Ideally you want to start with Lunar Blessing in order to increase your last hit power. Do not get it on level 1 if you expect your lane to be contested.",
				"luna_eclipse":"Avoid using it when there are creeps around. Treat it like a Juggernaut ult - look for isolated targets."
