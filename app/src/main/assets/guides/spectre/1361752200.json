				"vitality_booster":"This will give you extra health because of Spectre's frail situation. It may not be needed, hence situational.",
				"poor_mans_shield":"Spectre suffers during the laning phase and needs the Poor Man's Shield to actively farm and reduce the amount of damage intake from harassment.",
				"heart":"We typically get Heart of Tarrasque to survive longer, letting Dispersion to its job.",
				"radiance":"If you can farm this, get it! Otherwise, your mid-game core item of Diffusal Blade will greatly help you pick off foes with Haunt and Diffusal Blade's slow.",
				"butterfly":"Health from Heart of Tarrasque and Evasion from Butterfly makes Spectre an incredible annoyance and nearly unkillable before Spectre dies.",
				"manta":"Definitely a good item with Diffusal Blade and your passive abilities. Dish out further damage as you gank foes and pop Manta Style to be triple the threat.",
				"diffusal_blade":"Get level 2 if you run out of Diffusal charges, this is a great item when you are ganking for lonely supports or weakened lane-pushers. ",
				"ancient_janggo":"The survivability, aura and extra speed are intermission items to keep Spectre alive and make early ganks all the more worthwhile for him."

				"spectre_desolate":"This ability works great when you're ganking enemies via Haunt. We max this second as we ramp up ganks and the use of our Diffusal Blade.",
				"spectre_dispersion":"The longer you stay alive, the more damage you can deal to others. Consider getting more health-related items if you want to take advantage of this.",
				"spectre_haunt":"Cast Haunt to gank heroes who are farming alone as you can take them out fast. In addition, consider Haunt as a Boots of Travel whereas you can push another lane and use Haunt to get in on team-fights without delay! There is no cooldown to the number of times you can use Reality, so use it often!"
