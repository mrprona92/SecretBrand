		{
				"undying_decay":"Arguably the strongest level 1 skill in the game. Decay busts trilanes into pieces. The sizeable AOE makes it easy to hit several targets. SPAM this ability when you are able to get 2 or 3 people, then start going for kills! Paired with a good disable, first blood should be yours.",
				"undying_soul_rip":"Soul Rip. Meh. It's nice that its versatile (damage or heal) but the totals are just underwhelming. Wait on this ability as long as you can.",
				"undying_tombstone":"Want to turn a teamfight in a hurry? Tombstone can do that! The AOE starts out very small but becomes very big at levels 3 and 4. Save this ability for the right teamfight opportunity, the cooldown is long.",
				"undying_flesh_golem":"Flesh Golem is what keeps Undying undead. Pop that ability when shit hits the fan for instant debuffs to opponents and instant heals to you whenever something dies."
