				"dust":"For revealing invis heroes, if you prefer dust to sentries.",

Then keep buying wards throughout the game.

Even late game. Especially late game.",

				"tpscroll":"Side shop. Be ready to teleport to help out allies. A teleport and tombstone will turn a dive into a slaughter.",

				"vladmir":"Have a melee carry who already has an orb effect? Be a champion and pick up this item.",

Get a point in this if there is a Rubick on the enemy team, so you can cast this after Tombstone to make him cry.",

If there is a Rubick, DO NOT LET HIM STEAL THIS. Cast Soul Rip (just get a point) immediately after you cast this.",
