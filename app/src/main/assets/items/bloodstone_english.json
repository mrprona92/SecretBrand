Each charge grants 1 mana regeneration per second, reduces the gold lost from death by 25, and reduces respawn time by 4 seconds. If the bearer dies, 500 + 30 health per charge is restored to all allies within a 1675 radius, while the Bloodstone loses a third of its charges. A bloodmark is then placed where the bearer died, granting vision over a 1800 radius and allowing the bearer to gain nearby experience while dead.",
